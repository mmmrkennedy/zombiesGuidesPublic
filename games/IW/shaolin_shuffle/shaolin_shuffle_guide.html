        <h2>Chi Abilities/Fast Travel Portals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Chi Abilities are melee abilities that can be used once per round*. They can be upgraded by completing kill challenges. Once you pick your ability (see below), picking up any <a href="pictures/chi_fast_travel/gourd.webp">Gourd</a> around the map will recharge your chi ability.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>*The gourds do respawn after about five minutes, so they can be reused in a round if you're willing to wait.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>A Chi ability can be obtained by talking to <a href="pictures/pam.webp">Pam Grier in the Dojo</a> on/after Round 5, then by picking up one of the <a href="pictures/chi_fast_travel/all_gourds_dojo.webp">four Gourds around the Dojo</a>. All players can have the same style at the same time and, a style can be switched for another one by going to the Dojo and picking up that style's Gourd.</li>
            <li>There are four different "fighting styles" (Dragon, Tiger, Crane, and Snake) each with their own unique tier 3 and 4 abilities. At tier 1, you can only melee. Tier 2 adds a chargeable Shuriken attack that, when charged, can split into three Shurikens. Tier 3 adds a style-specific Chi ability and tier 4 adds a style-specific ultimate Chi ability.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Chi upgrade progress is not shared between fighting styles, so upgrading one style to max level will not upgrade others.</li>
                <li>Upgrade progress is saved if you switch styles, so if you switch to something, then switch back, you won't lose progress.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="sub-sub-step">Fast Travel Doors/Torii Gates</p>
            <li>The Chi can also be used to unlock Fast Travel Portals and open Torii gates around the map. These doors/gates can be opened by meleeing/throwing a shuriken to break them. The fast travel doors must be opened in pairs to activate them.</li>

Then head down to the disco and punch the <a href="pictures/nunchucks/clock1.webp">clock</a> inside. Finally, go down to the subway and punch that <a href="pictures/nunchucks/clock2.webp">clock</a>. A fire sale will spawn once you complete this step.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you take too long, you will be teleported back to the first clock, but you can retry immediately.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The Nunchucks will be the first item you get from the wheel during this fire sale. After completing this with any character once, the Nunchucks will become permanently available from the Mystery Wheel in any future game.</li>

            <li>Obtain a <a href="#chi_fast_travel">Chi ability</a> and level it up to Shurikens.</li>
            <li>Talk to <a href="pictures/pam.webp">Pam Grier</a> (whenever you need to talk to her to complete a step, if she is already speaking, you will have to wait for her to finish before you can interact with her); you need her to say "The one who terrorizes these streets...". This will spawn <a href="pictures/main_ee/eye/rat_cage_ramp.webp">rat cages</a> around the map.</li>
            <li>Throw a Shuriken at one of the rat cages to release the rat (any of the rat cages will work, so where you start is just personal preference). Here are some locations close to the Dojo:</li>

            <li>Follow the rat as it leads you to another cage. Each time the rat enters a cage, throw a Shuriken at the cage to release the rat and continue following it. After destroying the sixth cage, the cage will just disappear without the rat walking out and a <a href="pictures/main_ee/eye/glowing_circle_key.webp">large yellow circle</a> will appear near the last cage.</li>
            <li>Kill about 15-20 Zombies while THEY are inside the circle to make it disappear. Once the circle is gone, Ninja Zombies will start spawning.</li>

            <li>After shooting six symbols, one of the phones in either subway station will start ringing, and will not be lit up red. It will play a Morse Code message. There are only <a href="pictures/main_ee/brain/phone_morse_code_map.webp">six possible numbers</a> that the Morse code can be (<a href="/games/common_images/morse_code.webp">Morse Code Cheat Sheet</a> or <a href="https://morsedecoder.com/">Decoder website</a>). Listen to the first five beeps and compare them to the ones on the image. Four of the six options have different starting beeps, so they can be determined easily. 407 and 420 have the same starting beeps, so listen to the last five beeps; if the sequence ends with five long beeps, then your number is 420, otherwise its 407.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You MUST wait for the call to hang up. Hanging up early or being hit by a Zombie will cause you to not complete the step, and you will have to listen to the phone call again.</li>

            <li>Use explosives on the window to make the X disappear, then defeat the Ninja Zombies that spawn.</li>
            <li>Once all Ninjas are dead, <a href="pictures/main_ee/brain/letter_on_wall.webp">a letter will appear on the wall</a> right of the drop-down to the street and six symbols will spawn around the roof.

            <ul>
                <li>The word is random, and there is no way to know what it is exactly, but most of the time there will only be one or two letters that line up with one of the possible words.</li>
                <li>There is no immediate penalty for failing, and you can retry immediately (if you fail about nine times in one round, you will have to wait for the next round).

            <li>After three rounds, the game will skip ahead three rounds and lock you on the street outside the Dojo with fire blocking the exits.

            <li>Interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/heart/broken_turnstile.webp">broken turnstile gate in the spawn subway</a> to fix it.</li>

            <li>Go to the Disco and interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/heart/dj_booth.webp">DJ booth</a> on the second floor of the Disco to spawn a <a href="pictures/main_ee/heart/disco_ball_zombie.webp">Dancing Zombie with a glowing Disco Ball over its head</a> on the dance floor below. This Zombie is passive and will not attack you.</li>
            <li>Bring a normal Zombie to the dance floor and kill the Disco Ball Zombie while the other Zombie is on the dance floor. This will cause the Disco Ball to transfer to the new Zombie.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Killing the Disco Zombie without a Zombie on the dance floor will reset your progress. A new Disco Ball Zombie will spawn soon after.</li>

            <li>Once ready for the boss fight, speak to Pam in the Dojo and then enter the Rat King's lair in the sewers to start the final boss fight. Make sure you have a high ammo capacity bullet-based weapon (PAPed NV4 or similar should be fine) for the boss fight since you can soft-lock yourself if you don't have one, or run out of ammo during the fight.

        </ol>

        <ol>
            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step3">Rat King Boss Fight</p>
            <li>The Rat King can throw his shield at you, send a ground strike in your direction, and spawn Rat Ninja Zombies. Occasionally, he will defend himself using his shield. When this happens, a yellow armour marker will appear when you shoot him. The more you shoot him while his shield is raised, the longer he will hold it up.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You can destroy his staff by throwing a Chi Shuriken at it. After a minute or two, his staff will respawn.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>When you first enter the fight, you must deal damage to the Rat King. Once you've done enough damage, the Rat King will retreat to the rafters around the room, and the Eye, Brain, and Heart will appear on the ground.</li>
            <li>You must interact with one of the three organs and then interact with the big symbol on the floor in the centre of the room to activate that organ's challenge. Each organ triggers a specific challenge that you must complete; the challenges can be completed in any order. Completing a challenge will spawn a max ammo power-up in the middle of the room which does not despawn, so only pick it up when you need it. After completing a challenge, you will hear a gong sound, and you must damage the Rat King until he retreats to the rafters again.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Eye: The Eye will spawn in the centre of the room and scan the room about every 10 seconds, revealing pink symbols on the ceiling and walls around the arena (you can also manually scan using the eye you're holding). You must shoot all the symbols to complete this challenge. If you take too long, the Rat King will throw his shield around the arena, spawning symbols where it hits the walls.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you run out of ammo, there is no way to get more, and you will have to quit the game, unless you have some other means of hitting the symbols.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Heart: Acid will be dumped around the perimeter of the arena. Killing a Zombie in a puddle of acid will remove the acid for a short time. The goal is to clear the entire perimeter of acid before more is dumped into the arena. The acid can damage you if you stand in it for too long.</li>
                <li>Brain: The Brain will spawn on the ground in the middle of the room, and Zombies with blue eyes (they’re friendly and won't attack you) will spawn and start attacking the Brain. You must wait until they destroy the Brain, as well as defend them from the Rat King (you can kill these Zombies, so be careful). Destroying the Rat King's staff with a Shuriken can make this step faster, as he will be unable to kill the blue-eyed Zombies quickly. If a blue-eyed Zombie dies, another one will spawn.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>After completing the third challenge, you will be able to kill the Rat King by dealing enough damage. Once he is defeated, the ending cutscene will play, and the <a href="pictures/main_ee/soul_key.webp">Soul Key</a> will spawn in the middle of the room. If you're in Director's Cut, the <a href="pictures/main_ee/talisman.webp">Talisman</a> will spawn where the Soul Key was, and you will be given the <a href="pictures/main_ee/shaolin_dc.gif">Director's Cut III</a> animated calling card.</li>

            <li>Mahjong tiles have spawned in a row on the <a href="pictures/skullbuster/skull_2/mahjong_tiles.webp">roof of the Disco</a> right of the KBS Longbow. There are some missing tiles that you need to find to fill in the spaces. Your goal is to fill in the tiles so you have 14 tiles, then arrange them how you would for a winning hand in a real game of Mahjong. Use the solver below to find your winning hand or see the rules for a winning hand below.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>There might be at least one extra tile around the map that is not used in the winning hand. If you have one of these, swap it with another tile.</li>
                <li>You can only hold one tile at a time, so if you pick up a tile, you must place it on the roof before grabbing another. If you have a tile and pick up another, you will swap it with the one you're holding.</li>
                <li>Short description of how to make a winning hand: A winning hand consists of 14 tiles. You must form four sets of three tiles (either sequences like 1-2-3 or three identical tiles like 3-3-3) and a pair. There can only be four of the same tiles (1-1-1-1 is good but not 1-1-1-1-1).</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Tip: <strong>DO NOT SPRINT</strong>. All the jumps (except maybe the first one) can/should be made without sprinting. Sprinting may make you overshoot the circle you’re trying to land on.</li>

            <li>There will be a <a href="pictures/skullbuster/skull_5/skull_on_train.webp">skull on the front of the train</a> that runs through the Bang Bangs subway station. You have to jump in front of the train as it's going by (just standing on the tracks won't work). This will down you; if you’re solo and don’t have Up & Atoms, your game will end.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="side_ee_step7">The Skullbuster Mini-Game</p>
            <li>The game consists of three rounds, with each round requiring you to destroy all the skulls before they make it to the end. You have to form a group of three of the same colour skulls in either an L-shape or a straight line to destroy those skulls. Using the Entangler (your gun), grab a coloured cube floating around and shoot it at a question mark square to change its colour.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure you take into account the other possible groups for other colours. For example, imagine a blue group could be formed multiple ways, but a nearby red group could only be formed one way using one of the possible question mark blocks for the blue group. Thus, the blue group only has one actual way of forming that still allows the red group to form.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>If you hit a question mark with the wrong colour cube, you will get a strike. If you get three strikes, the game will end, and you will have to repeat the Skull 6 phone call.</li>
            <li>Once all three rounds are completed, you will be teleported back to the Disco, with all perks permanently (except Up & Atoms in Solo), and all weapons in the Mystery Wheel will be pack-a-punched for the remainder of the game.</li>
