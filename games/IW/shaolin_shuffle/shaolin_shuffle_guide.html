            <li>Throw a Shuriken at one of the rat cages to release the rat (any of the rat cages will work, so where you start is just personal preference). Here are some locations close to the Dojo: </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Up the ramp from the street in front of the Dojo</li>
                <li>In the side hallway in the Heebie Geebies</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Follow the rat as it leads you to another cage. Each time the rat enters a cage, throw a Shuriken to release it and continue following it. After releasing the final rat, the cage will just disappear and a <a href="pictures/">large yellow circle</a> will appear near the last cage.</li>
            <li>Kill zombies inside the circle until it disappears and Ninja Zombies start spawning.</li>
            <li>Once all Ninjas are dead, a <a href="pictures/">key</a> will appear where the circle was for you to pick up.</li>
            <li>In the Bang Bangs Subway Station, interact with the <a href="pictures/">locker with symbols on it</a> to reveal symbols inside.</li>
            <li>Shoot the following symbols around the map in order. If you shoot the wrong symbol, you'll have to restart at the first symbol. Symbol Locations:</li>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="pictures/">To the right of the Dojo - Second Symbol from left</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures/">In the bathroom of the Disco - Second Symbol from left</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures/">Above the Volk wallbuy near Deadeye Dewdrops - First Symbol from left</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures/">Above the Volk wallbuy near Deadeye Dewdrops - Second Symbol from left</a></li>
            </ol>
            <li>Interact with the <a href="pictures/">circle in front of the Black Cat Dojo</a> to spawn the Rat King. Kill him and pick up <a href="pictures/">the Eye</a> he drops.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step1">The Brain</p>
            <li>Talk to Pam.</li>
            <li>Use the eye (in your tactical slot) to find and reveal six <a href="pictures/">orange Rat King symbols</a> around the map. Shoot them when they appear.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Only one symbol spawns at a time.</li>
                <li>The eye will “recharge” after a few seconds.</li>
                <li>Possible locations include:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="pictures/">In the dojo above the main door</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/">In the window of a barber shop next to the dojo</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/">In the spawn area behind the train</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/">Behind a speaker in the Heebie Geebies</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/">On a water tower on the roof of the Inferno Disco</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/">In a window on the roof near the dojo</a></li>

                    <li><a href="pictures/">On top of an air duct in the Inferno Disco</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/">To the right of the Ripper wallbuy on another building</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/">Behind Bombstoppers, on a police car</a></li>

                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>After collecting six symbols, one of the phones in either subway station will start ringing. It will play a Morse Code message. There are only <a href="pictures/">six possible numbers</a> that the Morse code can be.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You MUST wait for the call to hang up. Hanging up early or being hit by a zombie will cause you to not complete the step, and you will have to listen to the phone call again.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Pick up the <a href="pictures/">Nightmare Summer poster</a> with the same “Film Registration” number as the Morse Code.</li>
            <li>Place the poster on the <a href="pictures/">spotlight</a>, revealing an <a href="pictures/">"X" on a window</a>.</li>
            <li>Use explosives on the window to make the X disappear, then defeat the Ninja Zombies that spawn.</li>
            <li>Once all Ninjas are dead, a letter will appear on the wall right of the drop-down to the street and six symbols will spawn around the roof. Using this <a href="pictures/">letter key</a> and the list of possible words below, you must spell one of the words based on the available letters. Once you find a letter that you think MIGHT be the next in the word, shoot it to add it to the word. If it is correct, the letter will be added to the word; otherwise, the word will reset back to one letter.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The word is random, and there is no way to know what it is exactly, but most of the time there will only be one or two letters that line up with one of the possible words.</li>
                <li>There is no penalty for failing and you can retry immediately. So if you get a long word (like ROLLERCOASTER or ROLLERSKATES) you can just fail it on purpose to try and get another (hopefully shorter) word.</li>

            <li>Talk to Pam. At the start of the next three rounds, a cigarette burn will appear on the top right of the screen.</li>
            <li>After three rounds, the game will skip ahead three rounds and lock you on the street outside the Dojo with fire blocking the exits. Kill all the enemies that spawn to cause a <a href="pictures/">turnstile piece</a> to drop and to remove the fire blocking the exits.</li>

            <ul>

            <li>Go to the Disco and interact with the <a href="pictures/">DJ booth</a> to spawn a Dancing Zombie with a glowing Disco Ball over its head on the dance floor.</li>
            <li>Lure a normal Zombie onto the dance floor and kill the Disco Ball Zombie only while another zombie is on the dance floor. This will cause the Disco Ball to transfer to the new zombie.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Killing the Disco Zombie without another zombie on the dance floor will reset your progress. A new Disco Ball Zombie will spawn soon after.</li>
                <li>If the Disco Ball Zombie is the last zombie of the round, you will have to kill it to start the next round, resetting your progress.</li>

            <li>A <a href="pictures/">Rat King Symbol</a> will spawn on the street in front of the Pink Cat. Activate it to fight the Rat King for the third time and claim his heart.</li>
            <li>Once ready for the boss fight, speak to Pam in the Black Cat Dojo and then enter the Rat King’s lair in the sewers to start the final boss fight. Make sure you have a high ammo capacity bullet-based weapon (PAPed NV4 or similar should be fine) for the boss fight since you can soft-lock yourself if you don’t have one, or you run out of ammo.</li>
        </ol>

        <ol>
            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step3">Rat King Boss Fight</p>
            <li>The Rat King can throw his shield at you, send a ground strike in your direction, and spawn Rat Ninja zombies. Occasionally, he will defend himself using his shield. When this happens, a yellow armour marker will appear when you shoot him. The more you shoot him while his shield is raised, the longer he will hold it up.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You can destroy his staff by throwing a Chi Shuriken at it.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>When you first enter the fight, you must deal damage to the Rat King using any weapon that isn’t explosive or melee. Once you’ve done enough damage, the Rat King will retreat to the rafters around the room, and the Eye, Brain, and Heart will appear on the ground.</li>
            <li>At this point, you must interact with one of the three and then interact with the big symbol in the center of the lair to activate its challenge. Each organ triggers a specific challenge that you must complete. The challenges can be completed in any order:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Eye: The eye in the center will scan the room, revealing pink symbols around the arena (you can also manually scan using the eye you’re holding.) You must shoot all the symbols to complete this challenge. If you take too long, the Rat King will throw his shield around the arena, spawning symbols where it hits the walls.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you run out of ammo, there is no way to get more, and you will have to quit the game.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Heart: Deadly acid will be dumped around the perimeter of the arena, and the acid can damage you if you stand in it for too long. Killing a zombie in a puddle of acid will remove the acid for a short time. The goal is to clear the entire perimeter of acid before more is dumped into the arena.</li>
                <li>Brain: The Brain will spawn on the ground in the middle of the room and Zombies with blue eyes (they are friendly and won’t attack). The Zombies will start attacking the Brain. You must wait until they destroy the Brain, as well as defend them from the Rat King. Destroying the Rat King’s staff with a Shuriken can make this step faster, as he will be unable to kill the blue-eyed zombies quickly. If a blue-eyed Zombie dies, another one will spawn shortly after.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>After completing the challenge, you will hear a gong sound, and you must again damage the Rat King until he retreats to the rafters again.</li>
            <li>After completing the third challenge, you will be able to kill the Rat King by dealing enough damage. Once he is defeated, the ending cutscene will play, and the <a href="pictures/">Soul Key</a> will drop where the Rat King was killed. If you're in Director's Cut, the <a href="pictures/">Talisman</a> will spawn where the Soul Key was.</li>

        <h2>Billionaire's "Trolltastic" Treasure Hunt (Trollface Calling Card)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You must find a radio that mentions the "eccentric billionaire David Savage" when interacted with. The radio locations are the same ones used in the Hidden Song easter egg.</li>
            <li>Once you have found the specific radio, head to the roof of the Inferno Disco and look directly at the <a href="pictures/">Savage Industries clock</a>. When done correctly, a Wyler Language cipher will appear on the clock.</li>
            <li>You must now interact with all 12 <a href="pictures/">standing trash cans</a> in the Subway Stations by holding interact on them. The trash cans will make a sound when interacted with. After activating the trash cans, aim at the <a href="pictures/">dumpster across from Mule Munchies</a>, and another cipher will appear.</li>
            <li>Aim at the <a href="pictures/">stop sign</a> on the street below the Electric Barbed Wire trap bridge near Racin’ Stripes to spawn another cypher.</li>
            <li>In the Inferno Disco, there is an inaccessible staircase in the same hallway as Trail Blazers. Crouch and look directly at the <a href="pictures/">roof above the staircase</a> to spawn the cypher.</li>
            <li>The next cipher is in the Spawn Subway behind a <a href="pictures/">gated door, to the right of the bank</a>. Aim directly at the wall, and the cipher will appear.</li>
            <li>This next cipher will only spawn between 12:00 AM and 1:00 AM Eastern US Time (the equivalent in your local time is <span id="timezone_conversion"><strong>TIME_1</strong> to <strong>TIME_2</strong></span>). The cipher is located on the <a href="pictures/">wall to the left of Tuff 'Nuff</a>.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Changing your console/PC’s date or time will not work.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Aim at the <a href="pictures/">Rat King's chair</a> in the Sewers. An image of David Savage and his treasure will appear, and you will be awarded the Trolltastic calling card.</li>
