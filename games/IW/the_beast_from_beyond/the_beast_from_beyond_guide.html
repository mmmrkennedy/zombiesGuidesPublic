                        <li>At the top, we have some variable declarations:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>C = List of available colours (Red, Green, Blue, Black, Yellow, and White)</li>
                            <li>W = List of the number of each colour ([“red”, “green”, “green”] would be [1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0])</li>
                            <li>S = Number of different colours ([“red”, “green”, “green”] would be 2)</li>
                            <li>B = List of the buttons</li>
                            <li>X = Number of buttons</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>So based on your X (the number of buttons) look at that box on the image. Let's say we have [“red”, “blue”, “black”, “green”], so X = 4.</li>
                        <li>We start with c1 in the X=4 box. This condition is sum(y) > 1 && S >= 2, which means “The number of yellow buttons greater than 1 and S greater than or equal to 2”. If this is true, we take the part after the “?”; if it’s false, then we take the part after the “:”.</li>
                        <li>Since in our case c1 is false, we go to c2. c2 is BL(w) && sum(b) = 0, which translates to “Is the last button white and are there 0 blue buttons”. Both conditions are false so we go to c3.</li>
                        <li>c3 is sum(bl) > 1 meaning “The number of black buttons is greater than 1”. This is false so we go to c4.</li>
                        <li>c4 is B3 which means press button 3.</li>

            <li>While a Zombie is in the chamber, go to the room above Bombstoppers and interact with the <a href="pictures/">middle console</a> to “bypass SuperUser privileges.” This will activate the <a href="pictures/">consoles on either side of the middle one</a>.</li>
            <li>The two consoles will now show a yellow square, red square, and blue diamond on the top screen. Your goal is the move the red square to the blue diamond while avoiding the invisible walls. Use this image or the interactive solver below to know the path to take.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Failing any of the mazes will kill the Zombie in the chamber, and spawn a Phantom. You can retry on the next round with a new Zombie in the chamber.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>To move the red square, place your crosshair in the middle of the top screen, and use the D-Pad (PC players see below for how to set your keybinds to work) to move the red square. The square can only be moved about once per second, so wait between “movement inputs”.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>PC Players: In Controls Options -> Actions, set “Use Souvenir” to Left Arrow, “Toggle Kung-Fu Mode” to Right Arrow, “Next Card” to Up Arrow, and “Previous Card” to Down Arrow. With these binds, you can move the square with the arrow keys like you would with a D-Pad.</li>

            <li>Unlock Pack-a-Punch.</li>

            <li>In the hallway with the Proteus wallbuy, there will be a fence blocking a red room, under/near some stairs.</li>
            <li>The vent on the floor at the end of the room will occasionally emit smoke and the Floppy Disk will be sitting on the floor in front of the vent. Using the Entangler, grab the Floppy Disk, and shoot it at the vent while the smoke is visable.</li>
            <li>If you miss or shoot at the wrong time, the Disk will respawn on the floor, and you can retry.</li>
            <li>If done correctly, the Floppy Disk will be sucked up and not respawn on the floor. It will be spit out of one of the vents near the floor around the hallway or Spawn.</li>
            <li>Spawn - Left of the Magic Wheel</li>
            <li>Cafeteria - Left of the Freezer, around the corner</li>

            <li>Hallway - At the top of the stairs</li>
            <li>Hallway - Close to the door to the Ops Center</li>
            <li>The Floppy Disk will stay in this location for the remainder of the game.</li>
            <li>Floppy Disk 4</li>
            <li>Obtain the Entangler weapon from Skull 2 of the Skull Breaker side quest.</li>
            <li>Using the Entangler, grab a Space Helmet in the Hallway between the outside and the Cargo Bay.</li>
            <li>Carry it over to the Medical Bay, where there is a door blocked by a force field. You need to shoot the helmet through the force field at the active monitor, above the microscope, to break it and disable the force field.</li>
            <li>If you miss, grab another helmet from the hallway or spawn area, and try again.</li>
            <li>The Floppy Disk can be picked on from the table left of the broken monitor.</li>
            <li>Once you have access to all four Floppy Disks, you must insert them into N31L in the correct order based on the symbols on them. Use this image or the solver below to find the correct order. There are four slots in front of N31L that the disks can be placed in.</li>
            <li>To use the image, find the row with all your disk symbols, then order your disks in that row’s order from left to right.</li>
            <li>If done correctly, your scoreboard HUD will flash yellow, then red, and N31L will turn “evil.” While evil, N31L will randomly close doors (this can kill you but will most of the time just close in front of you), which you can open for free by interacting with them, and he will randomly activate traps around the map.</li>
            <li>In the Theatre, use the Entangler to grab the button on the wall behind the Brute cardboard cutout. Take it to the Consession area, and shoot it into one of the Beast From Beyond posters.</li>
            <li>Go to the force field room in the Medical Bay. Prone in front of the table with the Floppy Disk on it, and interact with the button under the table.</li>
            <li>In the room with the dead cryptid, a panel with 16 handles inside will open. Note down all the handles that are currently horizontal.</li>
            <li>Now interact with all the handles you noted down. As you interact with the handles, some will spin, make sure you interact with the ones that were initially horizontal, even if they are now vertical.</li>
            <li>If you get to the end and some are still horizontal, flip the horizontal ones. Repeat until they are all vertical.</li>
            <li>Once all the handles are vertical, N31L will be hacked (not evil anymore).</li>
            <li>N31L will only be hacked for CHANGE ME before returning to evil.</li>
            <li>You need to grab N31L with the Entangler, bring him to the Projector Room, and shoot him at this computer to “install” him. The problem with this is that once you pick up N31L all the doors around the map will close which you can’t open, and Zombies will start spawning. The only way to open them is to go where N31L is looking as you’re carrying him, which will take you on a long tour of the map.</li>
            <li>This can and should be skipped one of two ways:</li>
            <li>Option 1 (Recommended): Before you pick up N31L, shoot the Entangler at a N31L TV, switch weapons (while shooting), and then switch back to the Entangler. This allows you to open doors while carrying N31L.</li>
            <li>Option 2 (Not as Recommended): Carry N31L like normal, but when you get to a locked door, spin around in front of it to (maybe) make it open.</li>
            <li>This works because N31L is coded to open the doors he is looking at. So when you spin, he doesn’t spin as fast as you, so you can kind of force him to look at a door.</li>
            <li>Once N31L is in the computer and you’re boss fight ready, you can interact with it to start the Boss Fight.</li>

            <li>Collecting the Skull will play the completion sound and spawn the Entangler in the middle of the Cargo Bay. The <a href="pictures/">Entangler</a> is the weapon used in the Ghost and Skulls mini-games and has a dedicated weapon slot.</li>

            <li>Go to the walkway with Bang Bangs in the Ops Center, then drop down to the Spawn. There will be a <a href="pictures/">red X</a> where you drop, and stand on it to make a <a href="pictures/">skull spawn in front of you</a>. This Skull will either be pink or green; this colour indicates the colour of the path you must follow.</li>
            <li>Walk to the skull to collect it. This will spawn coloured symbols on the floor in front of you. Walk (don’t sprint) from one coloured symbol to the next, and follow the path till you reach the Skull.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The game will often try to trick you and swap the colours of the next set of symbols, so be careful.</li>
                <li>Taking too long (indicated by the blue bar on the screen) or walking on the wrong symbol will fail the step, and you can retry the next round.</li>

            <li>Using the Entangler (your gun), grab a coloured cube floating around and shoot it at a skull to change its colour. If two skulls are the same colour, and beside/diagonal to each other, they will connect and form a group.</li>
            <li>Once you make a group of any size, you can then grab one of the nukes floating around, and fire it at the group of the same colour to destroy the group.</li>
