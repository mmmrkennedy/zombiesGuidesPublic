            <li>This will turn the power on, as well as replace the Cryptids with Zombies to return the map to "normal."</li>

            <li>You need to collect three pieces of scrap metal to build a bridge. Picking up a piece will spawn three Cryptids. Part locations:</li>

                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Once you have all three metal pieces, place them on the <a href="pictures/pap/broken_bridge.webp">broken bridge</a> in the outside area to repair it.</li>
            <li>Interact with the portal across the bridge to teleport to the Pack-a-Punch room.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>While in the projector room, you'll have 30 seconds to use the Pack-a-Punch before you're forcefully teleported back to the main map.</li>
                <li>Unlike the other maps, after you're teleported back, a Phantom or three Cryptids will spawn. Also, killing the first Phantom you kill will drop a part required for the Main Quest, so if you plan to do the Quest, remember where you kill it. These enemies will only spawn on the first teleport of a round.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>After being forcefully teleported back, the teleporter will go on cooldown for about one minute. After a minute, the teleporter will reactivate.</li>

            <li>Shoot open the <a href="pictures/double_pap/fuse_box.webp">power box on the wall</a> near the Proteus wallbuy, outside the Cargo Bay. Pick up the <a href="pictures/double_pap/fuse_box_open.webp">fuses inside</a>.</li>
            <li>Travel to the Theatre. Place the fuses on the <a href="pictures/double_pap/sasquatch.webp">hand of the Sasquatch cardboard cutout</a> in the hallway, between the main theatre room and the lobby area.</li>
            <li>Go to the concession stand in the Theatre, and pick up the <a href="pictures/double_pap/film_reel.webp">Film Reel</a> on the right side.</li>
            <li>Go to the Projector room and interact with the <a href="pictures/double_pap/projector.webp">film reels on the front of the projector</a> to replace the reel. The projector will now start projecting footage of Zombies in Spaceland.</li>
            <li>Obtain the Entangler (complete Skull 1 and 2 of the <a href="#skull_breaker" class="link-to-page">Skull Breaker Side Quest</a>).</li>
            <li>Activate the <a href="pictures/double_pap/wormhole_trap.webp">Movie Wormhole Trap</a> in the Theatre. While the trap is active, shoot the Entangler at the <a href="pictures/double_pap/vortex.webp">vortex on the screen</a> to pull out a Brute helmet. Drop the helmet on the ground, then interact with it to pick it up.</li>
            <li>Interact with the <a href="pictures/double_pap/brute.webp">Brute cutout near the Sasquatch</a> to place the head on it. If the fuses are already on the Sasquatch, the Brute head will shoot a laser at them, charging them.</li>
            <li>Once the fuses are charged, bring them to the Projector room and insert them into the Pack-a-Punch Projector. Once inserted, you will be able to Pack-a-Punch any Pack-a-Punched weapon again for 10,000 Points.</li>
            <li>The Alien Fuses will only be activated for the remainder of the CURRENT game.</li>

            <li>To access the theatre, you need to go to the Cargo Bay and interact with the <a href="pictures/theatre/button.webp">button on the wall</a> on the upper catwalk. A turret will come into the room and fire at the wall on the far side of the room.</li>
            <li>This will activate a <a href="pictures/theatre/portal_cargo.webp">portal to the theatre</a> on the other side of the Cargo Bay.</li>
            <li>Once in the Theatre, two other portals can be activated to go between the Theatre and the main map. To activate a portal, interact with the symbol on the ground in front of it. Portal locations:</li>

        <p class="weapon-desc">The Venom-X is a projectile weapon that shoots eggs that either explode after time or exploded manually by the player. The exploded egg leaves a cloud of gas that damages enemies inside. Killing Cryptids has a chance to drop an egg that can be picked up to partially refill ammo.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring a Phantom (big blue Cryptid) to the <a href="pictures/venom_x/water_trap.webp">Electric Water Trap</a> between Spawn and the Medical Bay. Activate the Trap while the Phantom is in the water.</li>

            <li>In the Ops Center (big main room), a <a href="pictures/venom_x/buttons.webp">box on the wall at the bottom of the stairs</a> near Bang Bangs will be open. There will be between 3-6 coloured buttons inside. Using <a href="venom/pictures/venom_x_button_info.webp">this image</a> (see explanation below) or the solver below, you will need to interact with the correct button.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>At the top, we have some variable declarations:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>C = List of available colours (Red, Green, Blue, Black, Yellow, and White)</li>
                            <li>W = List of the number of each colour (["red", "green", "green"] would be [1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0])</li>
                            <li>S = Number of different colours (["red", "green", "green"] would be 2)</li>
                            <li>B = List of the buttons</li>
                            <li>X = Number of buttons</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>So based on your X (the number of buttons) look at that box on the image. Let's say we have ["red", "blue", "black", "green"], so X = 4.</li>
                        <li>We start with c1 in the X=4 box. This condition is sum(y) &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; S &gt;= 2, which means "The number of yellow buttons greater than 1 and S greater than or equal to 2". If this is true, we take the part after the "?"; if it's false, then we take the part after the ":".</li>
                        <li>Since in our case c1 is false, we go to c2. c2 is BL(w) &amp;&amp; sum(b) = 0, which translates to "Is the last button white and are there 0 blue buttons". Both conditions are false so we go to c3.</li>
                        <li>c3 is sum(bl) &gt; 1 meaning "The number of black buttons is greater than 1". This is false so we go to c4.</li>
                        <li>c4 is B3 which means press button 3.</li>

            <li>In the same room, there is a <a href="pictures/venom_x/containment_chamber.webp">"Containment Chamber"</a> which you must trap a Zombie inside. To trap a Zombie, you must interact with the <a href="pictures/venom_x/containment_activate.webp">panel left of the Magic Wheel</a> while the Zombie is in the <a href="pictures/venom_x/containment_circle.webp">circle on the floor</a>. If done correctly, the Zombie will be trapped in the chamber, and a 300-second (5 minutes) timer will start counting down, which can be seen on the <a href="pictures/venom_x/containment_time.webp">top of the chamber</a>.</li>
            <li>While a Zombie is in the chamber, go to the room above Bombstoppers and interact with the <a href="pictures/venom_x/middle_console.webp">middle console</a> to "bypass SuperUser privileges." This will activate the <a href="pictures/venom_x/maze_screen.webp">consoles on either side of the middle one</a>.</li>
            <li>The two consoles will now show a yellow square, red square, and blue diamond on the top screen. Your goal is the move the red square to the blue diamond while avoiding the invisible walls. Use this image or the interactive solver below to know the path to take.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Failing any of the mazes will kill the Zombie in the chamber, and spawn a Phantom. You can retry on the next round with a new Zombie in the chamber.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>To move the red square, place your crosshair in the middle of the top screen, and use the D-Pad (PC players see below for how to set your keybinds to work) to move the red square. The square can only be moved about once per second, so wait between "movement inputs".</li>
            <ul>
                <li>PC Players: In Controls Options -&gt; Actions, set "Use Souvenir" to Left Arrow, "Toggle Kung-Fu Mode" to Right Arrow, "Next Card" to Up Arrow, and "Previous Card" to Down Arrow. With these binds, you can move the square with the arrow keys like you would with a D-Pad.</li>

            <li>To use the Venom-X, shoot a Cryptid "egg" onto the floor or a wall with the normal shoot button (R2 or Left Click). This egg will detonate after a couple of seconds, or it can be manually detonated with the aim button (L2 or Right Click).</li>

            <li>Interact with the <a href="pictures/venom_x/venom_y/key_terminal.webp">terminal right of Bang Bangs</a>.

                    <li>The message this terminal produces is encrypted with a Vigenere Cypher using the key obtained from the first terminal.

            <li>If done correctly, your scoreboard HUD will flash yellow, then red, and N31L will turn "evil." While evil, N31L will randomly close doors (this can kill you but will most of the time just close in front of you), which you can open for free by interacting with them, and he will randomly activate traps around the map.</li>
            <li>In the Theatre, use the Entangler to grab the <a href="pictures/main_ee/button_theatre.webp">button on the wall</a> behind the Brute cardboard cutout. Take it to the Concession area, and shoot it into one of the <a href="pictures/main_ee/beast_poster.webp">Beast From Beyond posters</a>.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you drop the button or otherwise fail, the button will respawn on the wall immediately.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Go to the force field room in the Medical Bay. Prone in front of the desk with the Floppy Disk on it, and interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/button_med_bay.webp">button under the desk</a>.</li>
            <li>In the room with the dead cryptid, a <a href="pictures/main_ee/handles.webp">panel with 16 handles</a> inside will open. Note down all the handles that are currently <strong>horizontal</strong>.</li>
            <li>Now interact with all the handles you noted down. As you interact with the handles, some will spin, make sure you only interact with the ones that were initially horizontal, even if they are now vertical.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you get to the end and some are still horizontal, flip the horizontal ones. Repeat until they are all vertical.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once all the handles are vertical, N31L will be hacked (not evil anymore).</li>
            <ul>
                <li>N31L will only be hacked for about 5 minutes before returning to evil. When he becomes evil again, you can hack him with the handles in the medical bay immediately.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>You need to grab N31L with the Entangler, bring him to the Projector Room, and shoot him at the <a href="pictures/main_ee/neil_computer_pap.webp">computer right of the projector</a> to "install" him. The problem with this is that once you pick up N31L, all the doors around the map will close, and you can't open, and Zombies will start spawning. The only way to open them is to go where N31L is looking as you're carrying him, which will take you on a long tour of the map.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This can and should be skipped one of two ways:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Option 1 (Recommended): Before you pick up N31L, shoot the Entangler at a N31L TV, switch weapons (while shooting), and then switch back to the Entangler. This allows you to open doors while carrying N31L. <a href="https://youtu.be/ed0xAyO3giA" class="external-link">Video Example (YouTube)</a>.</li>
                    <li>Option 2 (Not as Recommended): Carry N31L like normal, but when you get to a locked door, spin around in front of it to (maybe) make it open.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This works because N31L is coded to open the doors he is looking at. So when you spin, he doesn't spin as fast as you, so you can kind of force him to look at a door.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <p class="warning">Warning: Point of No Return. Once you interact with N31L, you will be put into the Boss Fight.</p>

            <li>Once N31L is installed, and you're ready for the boss fight, you can interact with it to start the Boss Fight.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step3">Cryptid Boss Fight</p>
            <li>After interacting with N31L, you will be teleported to a different Cargo Bay. A Laser Cannon will come into the room, and start targeting one of the crates.</li>
            <li>In one of the open crates, there is a <a href="pictures/main_ee/ammo_crate.webp">yellow, glowing box</a>. Interacting with this box will refill your currently held weapon's ammo for free. Refilling ammo can be done unlimitedly, so make sure to use it when you need it.</li>
            <li>The cannon will shoot the crate open, spawning a Rhino Cryptid. After a couple of seconds (whether you kill the Rhino or not), the cannon will shoot open another crate, spawning another Rhino. This will repeat for four total Rhinos.</li>
            <li>After a couple of seconds, the portals on one side of the room will activate, spawning normal Cryptids and Phantoms.</li>
            <li>After about a minute, the Cryptids will stop spawning, the portals will deactivate and barriers blocking the other parts of the arena will lower, unlocking the entire arena.</li>
            <li>The portals on the other side of the room will activate, spawning normal Cryptids and Phantoms.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I recommend (for most of the remainder of the boss fight) to camp inside the <a href="pictures/main_ee/sloped_crate.webp">sloped crate with a roof</a>. The Cryptids won't be able to get behind you, so you only need to worry about them coming from the bottom.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>After about a minute, all the portals will activate, and Cryptids, Phantoms, and an occasional Rhino will start spawning from them. The laser cannon will also start targeting you. The cannon can't shoot through things, so stand inside the sloped container mentioned earlier.</li>
            <li>After about 45 seconds, three monitors around the arena will turn on. You will need to quickly interact with all three monitors to turn off the portals. If you take too long, a monitor (and the portals near it) will reactivate.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I recommend (if you're camping in the crate) that you deactivate the monitors in the following order:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/console_1.webp">In the corner, behind and to the left of the Ammo Crate</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/console_2.webp">In the corner, behind and to the right of the Ammo Crate</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/console_3.webp">At the bottom of the sloped crate</a></li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
            <li>Once you deactivate all portals, Cryptids will stop spawning, and the laser will start firing erratically. It will eventually blow open a crate across from the ammo crate, revealing a computer with 99 on the front.</li>
            <li>It will begin counting down from 99 (it takes about 2:30 mins to count down, not 99 seconds). During this time, Cryptids, Phantoms and Rhinos will begin spawning from the portals.</li>
            <li>After the countdown reaches 0, the screen will display a string of jumbled characters and the computer will start sparking. Interact with it to despawn all Cryptids.</li>
            <li>The lights will go dim, and the laser will target a <a href="pictures/main_ee/mammoth_crate.webp">crate above the Ammo Crate</a>. After a couple of seconds, it will shoot it open, revealing two Mammoths (Blue Rhinos).</li>
            <ul>
                <li>These Mammoths can be insta-killed, using the Ego Trip F&amp;F card, and either the Mauler LMG with the Sentinal variant or the EBR-800 Sniper with the Bomber variant. See <a href="https://youtu.be/o9IU7jnKD9s?t=495" class="external-link">this video</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Decezy_" class="external-link">Decezy</a> for an example of this being done. If you don't kill them instantly (like in the video), keep shooting them in the mouth, they should die before the card runs out.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>These Mammoths are absolute bullet sponges, and will occasionally, when damaged, leave blue fire on the ground. This blue fire does a lot of damage and doesn't despawn, so make sure you think about where you're shooting the mammoths, so the fire doesn't block a doorway or choke point.</li>
            <li>The Mammoths will occasionally charge at you, which will always red-screen you even with Tuff 'Nuff.</li>
            <li>About every 30-60 seconds, the portals will activate, and about 3-5 Cryptids will spawn.</li>
            <li>Once both Mammoths are dead, the final cutscene will play. After the cutscene, you will be teleported back to the main map. There is no Soul Key or Talisman for you to pick up. If you complete the quest in Director's Cut mode, you will be given the <a href="pictures/beast_dc.gif">Director's Cut V</a> animated calling card.</li>
            <li>If you completed the Quest without Director's Cut, I recommend you don't keep playing. The map breaks after completing the Quest with rounds ending early, Cryptids spawn effects appear, but the Cryptid itself doesn't spawn, Pack-a-Punch becomes completely inaccessible, etc.</li>

            <li>A power box will spawn in one of the following locations. Using a grenade (or the OSA's under-barrel grenade launcher), blow up the <a href="pictures/skull_breaker/skull_1/box_cargo.webp">power box</a> to open it, revealing a <a href="pictures/skull_breaker/skull_1/skull.webp">Skull</a>.

            <li>Around the Cargo Bay, there are four <a href="pictures/skull_breaker/skull_2/red_x_upper.webp">red Xs on the floor</a>. All players need to stand on a different X to start a lockdown event. X Locations:</li>
            <ul>

Zombies will start infinitely spawning.</li>

            <li>Once the Skull reaches the top, it will <a href="pictures/skull_breaker/skull_2/skull_moved.webp">move somewhere</a> in the Cargo Bay. You must quickly run and jump into it to collect it.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>It will despawn after a few seconds so be quick. If you don't collect the Skull, you can retry the lockdown next round.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Collecting the Skull will play the completion sound and spawn the Entangler in the middle of the Cargo Bay. The <a href="pictures/skull_breaker/skull_2/entangler.webp">Entangler</a> is the weapon used in the Ghost and Skulls mini-games and has a dedicated weapon slot.</li>

            <li>Using the Entangler (your gun), grab a coloured cube floating around and shoot it at a skull to change its colour. If two skulls are the same colour, and beside/diagonal to each other, they will connect and form a group.</li>
            <li>Once you make a group of any size, you can then grab one of the nukes floating around, and fire it at the group of the same colour to destroy the group.</li>

Then interact with the Soul Jar in the Projector room of any map.</li>
            <li>This will allow you to toggle Director's Cut mode on the pre-game lobby screen.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <p class="step-group-title" id="what_you_can_do">What you can do with Director's Cut</p>
            <li>While in Director's Cut (DC for short), there are Talisman Masks you can shoot to unlock additional lobby music. See the Additional Lobby Music sections for each of the maps for more info.</li>
            <li>Upon completion of all the Quest again in DC, you will be given a Talisman to pick up. Upon collection of the Talisman, you will be rewarded with a special animated calling card based on the map.</li>
            <li>Once you collect four (not including Beast) Talismans, the next time you complete the Beast Main Quest, you will be put into the Mephistopheles Boss Fight. This is the final, and most challenging boss in this game (see the Mephistopheles Boss Fight section for how to beat him).</li>
            <li>Once you beat Mephistopheles, you will be rewarded with the animated calling card of Mephistopheles called "<a href="pictures/meph_dc.gif">Demon Slayer</a>" and an animated camouflage titled "Director's Cut Camouflage." As well as the ability to play as Willard Wyler on Spaceland (see the <a href="/games/IW/zombies_in_spaceland/zombies_in_spaceland_guide.html#wyler_code" class="link-to-page">Play as Willard Wyler</a> section of the Spaceland guide for more information).</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="meph_fight">Mephistopheles Boss Fight</p>
            <li>The Mephistopheles (Meph for short) boss fight is very complicated, and I feel I can't effectively explain it with in the website's format. See <a href="https://youtu.be/MRLTyFwOb8M?t=40" class="external-link">this video</a> (skip to <a href="https://youtu.be/MRLTyFwOb8M?t=271" class="external-link">4:31</a> to skip loadout tips) by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@steviewacky3945" class="external-link">Steviewacky</a> for how to beat the fight (he kinda yaps a bit, so I recommend you play the video at least 1.25x or 1.5x speed).</li>
            <li>Tips for completion:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS pay attention to Meph. All the attacks have specific animations that indicate the coming attack. The only exception to this is the Wall spawning/Zombie spawning animation, which share the "raises both arms" animation. I always assume this is the wall attack, and get out of the way.</li>
                <li>Prioritize safety over completion. There is no downside to taking your time and being safe. It will probably save you time when you consider the reset time (redoing the Beast Quest). Don't try to be the hero, and die standing on the talisman circle; just run, be safe, and try again.</li>
                <li>Practice in the Boss Battles mode. The worst part of the Meph fight is the long reset time when you die. This can be mitigated by playing in the Boss Battles mode in the lobby menu. You won't get the rewards, but you will be able to quickly retry the fight after dying.</li>
