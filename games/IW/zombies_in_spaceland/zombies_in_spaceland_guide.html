            <li>You must now defend the SETI-COM three times in three of the following locations; one per round. When
                you find the correct location to place the SETI-COM, your screen will shake, and you will be prompted to
                place it. Once you place the SETI-COM, Zombies will start infinitely spawning, and you must defend the
                SETI-COM till the timer runs out.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>The first defence takes 60 Seconds, the second is 90 Seconds, and the third is 120 Seconds.</li>
                <li>If you defend successfully, you will be able to pick the SETI-COM back up, and one of the Zombies
                    will drop a Max Ammo power-up. You will then have to wait till the next round to do the next
                    defence.
                </li>
                <li>If you fail to defend, you won't receive a Max Ammo, and a Brute will spawn. However, you can
                    immediately return to The 'Hoff to get a new SETI-COM to retry on the same round.

            <li>One full round after your last defence, return the SETI-COM to The 'Hoff, and he will give you four <a
                    href="pictures/main_ee/speakers.webp">speakers</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Around the Pack-a-Punch portal, there are three <a href="pictures/main_ee/golden_symbols.webp">Golden
                Symbols</a> on the ground, each representing the three main sections of the park. Place a speaker on
                each of these symbols, and then place the final speaker just <a
                        href="pictures/main_ee/final_speaker_location.webp">in front of the Pack-a-Punch portal</a>.
            </li>

            <p class="warning">Warning: Point of No Return. If you interact with any of the speakers, the Boss Fight
                will start.</p>

            <li><strong>RECOMMENDED NOT REQUIRED</strong>: Acquire any <a href="#headcutter">Weapon of Rock</a> Wonder
                weapon. It's recommended because the Weapons of Rock do heavy damage to the Alien Boss. Note: You will
                need one of the Weapons of Rock for steps after the Boss Fight, but it is not required for the Boss
                Fight.
            </li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step4">UFO and Alien Boss Fight</p>
            <li>This Boss Fight is split into two parts, Simon Says with the UFO and the Boss Fight with the Alien.</li>

            <p class="sub-sub-step" data-bool-quick-link="false">Simon Says with the UFO</p>
            <li>Once you are ready, interact with any of the speakers in the Cosmic Way. You will be locked in the
                Cosmic Way/Spawn area, and the four speakers will each shine a different colour light into the sky
                (<span style="color: red">Red</span>, <span style="color: dodgerblue">Blue</span>, <span
                        style="color: yellow">Yellow</span>, or <span style="color: green">Green</span>). Take note of
                each speaker's colour.
            </li>
            <li>Almost immediately after you've interacted with the speaker, Zombies will start infinitely spawning, and
                the UFO will flash all four colours with a sound going with each; note down the order of the colours.
                Once the UFO is finished, the UFO and the speakers will glow white, waiting for your input. Interact
                with the speakers in the same order as the UFO, for example, if the UFO flashes Yellow, Red, Blue, and
                Green, repeat that back to the UFO.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>You have 15 seconds to input the first colour from the time the UFO turns white, and then 10 seconds
                    after that to input all the colours (on Solo). On Co-op, you are given less time to input the
                    colours, so you must coordinate inputs with the other players.
                </li>
                <li>If you are unsure of the order of the UFO's colours, or you don't think it would be safe to attempt
                    the input, <strong>DON'T</strong> attempt to respond. There is no penalty for not answering, but
                    there is a penalty for inputting colours in the wrong order.
                </li>
                <li>If you take too long to input the whole sequence (i.e. only input 1-3 colours) or respond
                    incorrectly, a Brute will spawn, and then after about 10-15 seconds, the UFO will flash the same
                    colour order again.
                </li>
                <li>After a successful response, the UFO will float around the arena for about 40 seconds, before
                    returning to the centre and starting another sequence.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <li>After you complete three rounds of Simon Says with the UFO, Clown Zombies will start spawning. After
                about 45-60 seconds of clowns, they will stop spawning, and the <a href="pictures/main_ee/alien_example.webp">Alien(s)</a> will step out of the
                Pack-a-Punch portal.
            </li>

            <p class="sub-sub-step" data-bool-quick-link="false">Alien Boss Fight</p>
            <li>Note: The number of Aliens will match the number of players in the game, for example, a two-player game
                will have two Aliens. This guide will describe the solo experience, but the principles of the boss fight
                stay the same, so the guide will still be useful to those playing in co-op.
            </li>
            <li>The Alien will teleport around the arena, mostly on the rooftops but not always. The Alien will
                occasionally shoot the player with their gun, launch an energy blast out of the other (gun-less) hand,
                or spawn Zombies near the player.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>The Alien's gun shoots a small, fast-moving projectile that does about one Zombie's hit worth of
                    damage. The blaster is used when you are far from the Alien.
                </li>
                <li>The energy blast is a larger, slower-moving projectile (when compared to the blaster shot) that does
                    about half your health's (with Jug) worth of damage and will also slow you for a couple of seconds
                    if it hits you. The energy blast is used when you are close to the Alien.
                </li>
                <li>When you kill a lot of Zombies, the Alien will spawn more at your feet, to get them quickly back
                    into the fight.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <li>To do damage to the Alien, you must shoot it in the <a href="pictures/main_ee/alien_collar.webp">glowing
                collar</a> on its neck. The colour of the collar indicates the amount of health the Alien has; green is
                high, yellow is medium, and red is low.
            </li>
            <li>Once you do enough damage to the Alien, it will teleport to the playable area (i.e. not on a rooftop),
                create a bubble shield around itself, spawn Zombies, and then kneel on the floor in a <a
                        href="pictures/main_ee/alien_downed.webp">downed state</a>. While the Alien is down, you must
                quickly melee a fuse in its backpack. If done correctly, you will hear a breaking sound, the Alien will
                jump up and drop an energy ball at its feet, and the next Zombie you kill will drop a Max Ammo.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Note: Sometimes the Alien will skip the bubble and Zombies spawning, and go straight to the downed
                    state.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>You will need to repeat this two more times. The third time the Alien is "downed", you don't need to
                melee a fuse, the Alien will just simply die, and the Boss Fight will end.
            </li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step5">Destroying the UFO</p>
            <li>Once the Alien is dead, the <a href="pictures/main_ee/fuses.webp">Alien's Fuses</a> will appear in front
                of the Pack-a-Punch portal, and you will be able to leave the Cosmic Way. The UFO will still be floating
                above the Cosmic Way, and will occasionally shoot energy shots at you.
            </li>
            <li>Enter the projector room and insert the Alien Fuses into the Projector. This will <a
                    href="pictures/main_ee/upgraded_pap.webp">upgrade it</a> for the remainder of the current game. You
                will be able to Pack-a-Punch any weapon a second time for 10,000 points and Pack-a-Punch the Weapon of
                Rock wonder weapons once for 5000 points.
            </li>
            <li>Craft any <a href="#headcutter">Weapon of Rock</a> wonder weapon, if you haven't already, and
                Pack-a-Punch it.
            </li>
            <li>Using an upgraded wonder weapon, shoot four of the five <a
                    href="pictures/main_ee/power_nodes_on_ring.webp">"power nodes" on the Spaceland Ring</a> around the
                bridge from spawn. When shot, the node will turn <a href="pictures/main_ee/orange_node.webp">orange</a>
                and arc electricity to surrounding nodes.
            </li>
            <li>Once you have shot 4 of 5 nodes, you must time your shot on the last nodes for when the UFO is above the
                Pack-a-Punch portal. When you activate all five nodes, the Spaceland Ring will charge for about 3
                seconds before shooting a laser at the device above the Pack-a-Punch portal. The device will redirect
                the laser straight up.
            </li>
            <li>If the UFO is in the path of the laser, it will light on fire, fly into the air and explode, and the <a href="pictures/main_ee/soul_key.webp">Soul Key</a> will spawn in front of the Pack-a-Punch portal. If you are in Director's Cut mode, the <a href="pictures/main_ee/talisman.webp">Talisman</a> will spawn after the Soul Key is picked up in the same spot, and you will be given the <a href="pictures/main_ee/spaceland_dc.gif">Director's Cut I</a> animated calling card.</li>
            <li>The final cutscene on this map will only play if you are playing as <a href="#wyler_code">Willard Wyler</a>; otherwise, there is no ending cutscene.

            </li>
            <ul>

                    (either of the two machines, not both) - Randomly a Skull will appear, and when it does, you must
                    score the basket before it disappears
                </li>
                <li><a href="pictures/ghost_and_skulls/skull_4/black_hole.webp">Black Hole</a> - Score 50 points</li>
                <li><a href="pictures/ghost_and_skulls/skull_4/cryptid_attack.webp">Cryptid Attack</a> - The skull will
                    randomly appear over one of the sets of teeth; hit the teeth below the skull
                </li>
                <li><a href="pictures/ghost_and_skulls/skull_4/zombie_zoom.webp">Zombie Zoom</a> - You must pass the
                    skull before the grey Zombie does. Tip: Activate the Disco Ball trap to get the Zombies off of you
                    and spam the shoot button instead of holding it down because if you mash, the gun's recoil doesn't
                    kick in.
                </li>
                <li><a href="pictures/ghost_and_skulls/skull_4/bowling_for_planets.webp">Bowling for Planets</a> - The
                    skull will randomly appear in one of the holes; you will need to shoot your ball in the same hole
                    before the skull disappears. This is by far the most annoying to get as the game's physics and
                    controls are awkward at best.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once get all the skulls in each game, the completion sound will play.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="side_ee_step5">Skull 5/6 - Main Quest</p>
            <li>Complete the entire <a href="#main_ee">Main Quest</a>.</li>
            <li>Pick up the <a href="pictures/weapons_of_rock/dischord/sunglasses.webp">Sunglasses</a>, which Zombies
                randomly drop.
            </li>
            <li>While you have the sunglasses equipped, there will be a <a

            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>The Sunglasses must stay on till the skull is destroyed. If you take them off too early, the skull
                    won't be destroyed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once the skull is destroyed, the completion sound will play.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="side_ee_step6">Skull 6/6 - Brute Laser</p>
            <li>Wait for a Brute to spawn. Once it does, lure it to the <a
                    href="pictures/ghost_and_skulls/ghost_and_skulls_machine.webp">Ghost N' Skulls</a> machine and bait
                it into firing its laser beam attack at the machine.
            </li>
            <li>If done correctly, the machine will <a href="pictures/ghost_and_skulls/glowing_machine.webp">have all 6
                skulls and electricity will start coming off the screen</a>. This means that the machine is ready to be
                "played". All players must interact with the arcade cabinet to enter the game.
            </li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="side_ee_step7">The Ghost N' Skulls Mini-Game</p>
            <li>The game consists of three rounds, with each round requiring you to destroy all the skulls before they
                make it to the end (similar to Space Invaders). Using the Entangler (your gun), grab a ghost floating
                around and shoot it at the skull to destroy it.
            </li>
            <li>Occasionally, a Skull will turn red and, after a few seconds, attempt to escape by flying to the vortex
                at the back of the arena. If three skulls escape in one round, the game will end, and you will have to
                get the Brute to laser the machine again to try again.
            </li>
            <li>Once all three rounds are completed, you will be teleported back to the Astrocade, with all perks
                permanently (except Up & Atoms in Solo).
