            <li>Before you use the Boat, pick up the <a href="pictures/pap/film_reel_docks.webp">Film Reel</a> on the Docks.</li>
            <li>Once you've collected all three parts, the Boat can be used inside the <a href="pictures/pap/boathouse.webp">Boathouse</a> on the Docks. After a slow ride, you will be dropped off on Turtle Island.</li>
            <li>Pick up the <a href="pictures/pap/film_reel_cabin.webp">Film Reel</a> just outside the backdoor of the Cabin.</li>
            <li>Once you have both film reels, interact with the <a href="pictures/pap/broken_proj.webp">Broken Projector</a> in the Cabin to fix it. This will cause the Projector to project a portal on the wall.</li>
            <li>Interact with the portal on the wall to teleport to the Pack-a-Punch room.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>While in the projector room, you'll have 30 seconds to use the Pack-a-Punch before you are forcefully teleported back to the main map.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>After being forcefully teleported back, the teleporter will go on cooldown for about one minute. After the minute is up, the teleporter will reactivate.</li>

        <h2>Rave Mode</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Rave Mode is a special mode a player can enter that adds visual effects to the map, such as adding coloured effects to the Zombies and environment. While in Rave Mode starting on round 10, the <a href="pictures/rave_mode/slasher.webp">Slasher</a> will spawn. The Slasher can't be killed with any standard weapon; He can only be killed with the <a href="#smiley">Smiley</a>, which you get after the <a href="#main_ee">Main Quest</a>.</li>
            <li>Rave Mode can be activated by first, getting a <a href="pictures/rave_mode/rave_mode_pouch.webp">Rave Mode Pouch</a> (which Zombies randomly drop, starting about round 3), and then interacting with any fire around the map. Entering Rave Mode will use the Pouch, and you will have to get another one to re-enter Rave Mode.</li>
            <li>Entering Rave Mode is per-player, meaning if one player enters Rave Mode, the other players don't enter Rave Mode as well.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Players can "share" a Rave Mode Pouch by standing near the player with the Pouch when that player activates Rave Mode.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>By default, Rave Mode lasts for one minute, but killing Zombies will shorten the duration by a couple of seconds. Taking Damage, buying things, activating F&F Cards, and reviving other players does not affect the duration.</li>
            <li>Rave Mode can be extended by interacting with <a href="pictures/rave_mode/fairies.webp">Fairies</a> around the map. Each group of Fairies you interact with will extend the duration of Rave Mode by about 30 seconds. Once a group of Fairies is interacted with, it will disappear for the remainder of the current Rave Mode.</li>
            <li>Players will earn double points while in Rave Mode, making it a good early-game way to make points.</li>
            <li>While in Rave Mode, you can find <a href="pictures/rave_mode/door_owl_camp.webp">doors made of sticks</a> that can only be seen and bought in Rave Mode. Outside Rave Mode, these doors will be wooden railings or walls.</li>

        <h2>'Vlad' Crossbow Wonder Weapons</h2>
        <p class="weapon-desc">The Vlad Crossbow is a crossbow that fires explosive bolts. The Vlad can be upgraded into four variants, <a href="#whirlwind">Whirlwind EF-5</a>, <a href="#whirlwind">Trap-o-matic</a>, <a href="#whirlwind">Acid Rain</a> or <a href="#whirlwind">Ben Franklin</a>. The Vlad and its variants can't be upgraded using the Pack-a-Punch machine, even with the Fuses installed.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Unlock the <a href="#pap">Pack-a-Punch</a>.</li>
            <li>While on Turtle Island, interact with this <a href="pictures/vlad/hot_dog_bucket.webp">Bucket</a> in the Bathroom of the Cabin to pick up a Hot Dog. This will replace your tactical equipment with a throwable Hot Dog which will go on a CHANGE ME cooldown after being thrown.</li>
            <li>Pick up a <a href="pictures/rave_mode/rave_mode_pouch.webp">Rave Mode Pouch</a>, which Zombies randomly drop. Interact with the <a href="pictures/vlad/bear_lodge_fireplace.webp">Fireplace in the Bear Lodge</a> (you can enter Rave Mode at any fire location, the spawn fire just works the best) to enter Rave Mode.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>For more information on Rave Mode, see the <a href="#rave_mode">Rave Mode</a> section.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Around the map, there are three Deer heads mounted on walls. While in Rave Mode, throw a Hot Dog at a Deer head to cause it to fly off the wall and start floating around. While the Deer's head is in the air, shoot it with any weapon till it breaks. This will drop a <a href="pictures/vlad/glowing_symbol.webp">Glowing Symbol</a> for you to pick up. Deer head Locations: </li>

            </ul>
            <li>Once you have collected all three symbols, exit Rave Mode (by waiting out the timer, killing Zombies to lower the timer, or going down). Once you're out of Rave Mode, interact with the <a href="pictures/vlad/crossbow_cabinet.webp">Crossbow Cabinet</a> in the Bear Lodge. The lock on the cabinet will disappear, and the Vlad will become available for pickup.</li>

        <p class="step-group-title" id="whirlwind">Vlad Upgrade Variants</p>
        <p class="weapon-desc">The Whirlwind EF-5 will fire a projectile that will blow back any Zombies caught in its area (very similar to the Thundergun). The Trap-o-Matic will make the crossbow akimbo, and if two (or more) bolts are fired close enough together on the ground, a laser will connect them, killing any Zombie that walks through it. The Acid Rain will rain acid on the area around where the bolt lands for a couple of seconds. The Ben Franklin will cause a bolt of lightning to strike where the bolt lands; the bolt of lightning is small and will only kill a few Zombies.</p>
        <ol start="0">
            <li>There are four upgrades with each of them roughly sharing the same steps to get, except for Step 6. Also, the Vlad is not required until Step 5.</li>
            <li>Around the map are four different animal statues, each corresponding to an upgrade. All the statues share the same pool of spawn locations, for example, in one game the Deer statue might spawn where the Owl spawned previously. You only need to collect the statue for the upgrade you wish to get, instead of needing to collect them all.</li>

            <li>You must now place the statue in front of an identical big statue in one of the following locations around the map.

            <li>Once you're on the island, you will be put into Rave Mode, and you must find and charge two (more on Co-op) <a href="pictures/main_ee/boss_fight_skull.webp">Skulls</a> with about 30 Zombie souls each. As a Skull is being charged, it will slowly move up into the air. Once it's fully charged, a <a href="pictures/main_ee/charged_skull.webp">large beam of light will illuminate the skull in the sky</a>. Shortly after being fully charged, the skull will slowly start to fall; it can be "re-charged" as it is falling to get it back to the max without it completely resetting. If you don't recharge the falling skull quickly enough, it will reset and will need to be fully recharged with souls.</li>
            <li>Once all skulls are charged, they will combine and form a <a href="pictures/main_ee/boss_circle.webp">circle</a> on the ground. You must bait the Super Slasher into walking onto the circle. When the Super Slasher is in the circle, his <a href="pictures/main_ee/glowing_part_on_slasher.webp">lower torso area will start glowing</a>. You must shoot the glowing area; if done correctly, you will exit Rave Mode.</li>
            <li>After a couple of seconds, a <a href="pictures/main_ee/symbol.webp">symbol</a> will appear somewhere on the Slasher's body. Shoot the symbol till it disappears; repeat this about eight times, until the Slasher visible recoils, and pounds on his chest.</li>
            <li>The Slasher will then spawn two saw blades on the ground that follow players. He will then jump up onto the Cabin, and summon a wind storm. All players must hide behind a rock in the <a href="pictures/main_ee/green_circle.webp">Green Circles</a> on the ground to avoid taking damage. While you're in the circle, skeletons will start spawning. The skeletons take much more damage to kill when compared to regular Zombies.</li>
            <li>After about 30 seconds, the wind will stop, and the circle will disappear. You will be put back into Rave Mode, where you must repeat Steps 1-4 two more times. The <a href="pictures/main_ee/dreamcatcher.webp">Dreamcatchers</a> above the Cabin indicate how many times you have shot the symbols on the slasher (Step 3), starting with 3 and going down every time you complete the step. The only difference between phases is that during the Rave Mode section, walls will spawn blocking off some pathways in the arena.</li>
            <li>On your third run-through, the wind storm will not happen. Instead, you need to shoot the Super Slasher till he is dead. Once he is dead, part of the <a href="pictures/main_ee/soul_key.webp">Soul Key</a> will spawn which will start the ending cutscene once picked up. If you're in Director's Cut, the <a href="pictures/main_ee/talisman.webp">Talisman</a> will spawn where the Soul Key was.</li>

To unlock the machine, they need to complete a specific set of side tasks to get six skulls. Completing the game unlocks all perks permanently (except for Up 'N Atoms in solo games), and allows you to get six revives on solo instead of the standard three or infinite Afterlife Arcade visits on Co-op.</p>

        <ol class="step-content">

            <ul>
                <li>A website like <a href="https://www.zombacus.com/zombiecalculator">Zombacus</a> can be used to calculate the number of Zombies each round. This makes it easier to know how many Zombies you need to kill to be left with the number you need to kill with the trap. When using the website, Infinite Warfare is considered to have a "Normal" spawn system. The website doesn't factor in special rounds (like the Bigfoot rounds), so the numbers on those rounds will not be correct.</li>

Throw a knife at the skull; if done correctly, the Skull will disappear, you will be awarded with $50, and the completion sound will play.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you fail to throw the knife at the skull in time, you will have to wait till the next round to retry since the Knife Game can only be played once per game.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="side_ee_step4">Coin 4/6 - Spell SKULL with Symbols</p>
            <li>Wait for one round after completing Coin 3 (if this round is a special round, you must wait till the next round). While in Rave Mode (start at the <a href="pictures/ghost_and_skulls_2/coin_2/campfire_turtle_island.webp">campfire on Turtle Island</a>), spell out the word "SKULL" by aiming at green symbols (same locations as Coin 2) around the map. Here is a <a href="../iw_symbol.webp">Graphic</a> containing the matching symbols and letters. The symbol locations: </li>
            <ul>
                <li>All the symbols don't have to be "activated" in the same Rave Mode. You can leave and return to Rave Mode, and your progress will be saved.</li>
                <li>If you aim at the wrong symbol, you will have to activate all five symbols, and then retry on the next round.</li>
                <li>Symbol Locations:</li>
                <ul>

            <li>Once you aim at all five letters in the right order, the completion sound will play.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="side_ee_step5">Coin 5/6 - Boat Shooting Gallery</p>
            <li>Get a weapon with a decent amount of ammo (Assault Rifle, like the NV4, or LMGs are recommended); you don't need to Pack-a-Punch it, though it is recommended for the increased ammo capacity.</li>
            <li>Ride the Boat; skulls will appear in front of you which you must shoot. Skulls that turn red are close to "escaping," and if a Skull escapes, you will fail. After about 10 seconds, all the Skulls will disappear, and the completion sound will play.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If a Skull does escape, all the skulls will disappear, and you can retry as soon as the Boat returns to the Boathouse.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="side_ee_step6">Coin 6/6 - Ben Franklin Bow</p>
            <li>Obtain the <a href="#whirlwind">Ben Franklin</a> upgraded crossbow.</li>
            <li>Shoot the Ghost N' Skulls Machine with the Ben Franklin. The machine will <a href="pictures/ghost_and_skulls_2/coin_6/glowing_machine.webp">have all 6 skulls and electricity will start coming off the screen</a>. This means that the machine is ready to be "played." All players must interact with the arcade cabinet to enter the game.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="side_ee_step7">The Ghost N' Skulls 2 Mini-Game</p>
            <li>The game consists of three rounds, with each round requiring you to destroy all the skulls before they make it to the end (similar to Space Invaders). This one is different (compared to GNS 1) because the Skulls are now different colours. Using the Entangler (your gun), grab a coloured ghost floating around and shoot it at the same coloured skull to destroy it.</li>
            <li>If you hit a Skull with the wrong colour ghost, the Skull will turn red and, after a few seconds, attempt to escape by flying to the vortex at the back of the arena. You can attempt to break this skull by shooting a red ghost at it while it is escaping. If three skulls escape in one round, the game will end, and you will have to shoot the Ben Franklin at the machine to try again.</li>
            <li>Starting on round 2 and continuing on round 3, the Skulls will flip around, hiding their colour. On round 2, they will flip back around, but on round 3, they will not flip back. You will have to either remember which skulls are what colour or take a screenshot/picture. Despite there being a couple of different patterns for each round (meaning you might have the same pattern as a guide or a previous run), the colour of each skull <i>seems</i> to be random.</li>
            <li>Once all three rounds are completed, you will be teleported back to the Bear Lodge, with all perks permanently (except Up & Atoms in Solo), and an additional three revives on solo or infinite Afterlife Arcade visits on Co-op.</li>
