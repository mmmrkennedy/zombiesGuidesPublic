            <li>Once the Vial is full, give it to Elvira. She will say some dialogue, then spawn in as a roaming ally (like David Hasselhoff in Spaceland).

        <ol>
            <li>Obtain the M.A.D. (Modular Atomic Disintegrator) from the Mystery Wheel and pick up the <a href="pictures/crowbar.webp">Crowbar from
                the maintenance room</a> of the Motel.</li>
            <li>There are three power boxes around the map that can be meleed open with the Crowbar. Inside each one is an upgrade part from the MAD. When picked up, each part will be automatically equipped on the MAD. Each part adds some new ability/upgrade to the weapon. Power Box locations:</li>

                    <li>The Crank allows the weapon to be charged (by holding the aim button) for a more powerful shot, which uses more ammo. When charged, you won't be able to crank it anymore, and the screen on the back of the MAD will show a "molecule" diagram. Swapping weapons after charging will "de-charge" the weapon.</li>

            <li>Note: Steps 3 and 4 can be done at the same time.</li>
            <li>You need to collect six body parts (Two arms, two legs, a torso, and a head) of a Zombie, which are scattered around the map. Each part can be collected at any time, in any order.</li>

                    <li>As the Generator slams the ground, the arm will slowly rise from the ground. Once the arm stops moving up, you can pick it up.</li>

                        <li>The first Radioactive Zombie you kill will always drop the leg.</li>
                        <li>The leg doesn't seem to despawn (that I could determine that is; maybe it does), so if you can't get it to drop, it means it already on the ground somewhere, and you need to find it.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Only standard-style grenades (Frag, Cluster) work consistently. Bio-spikes and C4 could, theoretically work, with the Bio-spike requiring a kill right below the leg to trigger the explosion close enough.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
            </ul>
            <li>You need to collect three different pieces of glass (Elvira's Mirror, a broken mirror piece, and a car side mirror). Each part can be collected at any time, in any order.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Elvira's Mirror - You need to summon Elvira (by giving her a filled Vial) and then wait for her to "despawn". Once she's despawned, go to the TV Station and interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/elviras_mirror.webp">mirror on the couch</a>; you can pick it up when it says, "Elvira is not here right now".</li>
                <li>Broken Mirror Piece - Obtain the <a href="pictures/crowbar.webp">Crowbar</a> from the maintenance room of the Motel. Go to the RV Park bathroom, and melee the <a href="pictures/main_ee/unbroken_mirror.webp">unbroken mirror</a>. A <a href="pictures/main_ee/broken_mirror.webp">piece of the mirror will fall into the sink</a> below for you to pick up.</li>
                <li>Car Side Mirror - Obtain the <a href="pictures/crowbar.webp">Crowbar</a> from the maintenance room of the Motel. On the main street, melee the <a href="pictures/main_ee/car_mirror.webp">right side mirror of the white car with a roof</a>. The <a href="pictures/main_ee/car_mirror_ground.webp">mirror will fall to the ground</a> for you to pick up.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once you have all six body parts and the three pieces of glass, go to the spawn room (room with Up & Atoms) and place the body parts on the <a href="pictures/main_ee/upright_bed.webp">upright bed</a> right of the tunnel out of the room. Then place the broken mirror on the <a href="pictures/main_ee/pill_bottles.webp">table with the pill bottles</a> left of the body. Place Elvira's Mirror on the <a href="pictures/main_ee/crates_zm_spawn.webp">crates, right of the Zombie spawn</a>, right of the body. Place the Car Mirror on the <a href="pictures/main_ee/large_crate.webp">large crate</a>, across from/to the right of Up & Atoms.</li>
            <li>Pick up the <a href="pictures/main_ee/punch_card.webp">punch card</a> on the desk in the backroom of the Ice Cream Parlour.</li>
            <li>Interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/machine_in_spawn.webp">machine in spawn</a> (right of the car mirror) to give it the punch card.</li>
            <li>Interact with the machine again to begin inputting numbers. To input a number, you must press the interact button (or left click on PC) when that number's light is lit up (the numbers are 0-9, so the first light on the left is 0). Your goal is to find your combination of the numbers 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8. The numbers can be in any order, but they don't repeat.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You have to just simply do trial and error to find the combination, as there's no way to know what the correct answer is.</li>
                <li>If you input three wrong numbers, you will be kicked off the machine, but you can try again immediately. The number combination doesn't reset when you fail, so if you get 864, and then fail, you can get back on the machine and enter 864 again to get back where you were.</li>
                <li>Taking damage from a Zombie will kick you off the machine.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once you get your correct number order, make sure to remember the number, it will be used later. Interact with the machine again; this will cause a laser beam to bounce around the room, eventually hitting the body parts to form a full Zombie.</li>
            <li>You must now interact with the machine again and input your number backwards. Once input, interact with the machine and the Zombie will become a <a href="pictures/main_ee/key.webp">key</a> for you to pick up.</li>
            <li>Interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/garage_door.webp">Garage Door</a> of the Gas Station on the main street to open it.</li>
            
            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step2">Preparing for the Chemistry Step</p>
            <li>You must now collect three parts, a Tube, a Gauge, and a Screen, to build a Chemistry Set in the garage.</li>

            <p class="sub-sub-step" id="main_ee_step2_sub1">Building the Nuke</p>
            <li>You must now collect three parts to add to the nuke in the garage.</li>

            <li>Once you have all three parts, interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/nuke.webp">nuke in the Garage</a> to place the parts.</li>
            
            <p class="sub-sub-step" id="main_ee_step2_sub2">Opening the Safe</p>
            <li>Obtain the <a href="pictures/crowbar.webp">Crowbar</a> from the maintenance room of the Motel. Go to the room with the safe and desk in the back of the Market. Prone on the left side of the <a href="pictures/main_ee/desk.webp">desk</a>, and note down the <a href="pictures/main_ee/desk_prone.webp">four numbers there</a>.</li>
            <li>You must now set four pressure gauges around the map, to one of the numbers (any number can go with any gauge). To set a gauge, you must melee it with the crowbar while the hand is pointing at the number you want. If you stop the hand on the wrong number, you can melee the gauge again to reset it. Gauge locations:</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step3">The Chemistry Step</p>
            <li>There are two ways to do the "Chemistry Step" (the bulk of the remainder of this quest), the IW intended way or using the Solver below.

                        <li>Go to the TV Station and interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/control_panel.webp">control panel</a> to change the map's colour. There are four options for you to change it to, Full Colour (default), Red, Green, and Blue. Change it to Red.</li>
                        <li>In each of the three special colour modes, you must look around the map at each of the four "O Number" locations. In Full Colour, all of these will show <a href="pictures/main_ee/o_num_equal.webp">"O = #"</a> with # being a number, but in each of the colour modes, one of them will be showing <a href="pictures/main_ee/o_num_not_equal.webp">"O ≠ #."</a> That means the number is not your O Number.

                        <li>Keep changing the colour and look at the O number locations until you find one that is "O = #" in Red, Green, and Blue. That is your O Number for the game. You can change the colour back to Full Colour for now.</li>
                        <li>Once you have both your O and N numbers, multiply them together, then go to the TV Station. On the <a href="pictures/main_ee/elvira_tv.webp">TV beside Elvira, there will be numbers and colours</a>. Compare your new number to the numbers on the TV to get your colour.

                            <li>Example: Your number is 106 and the TV says, "< 107 Green, 107 - 109 Blue, > 109 Red", your colour would be Green because it's less than 107.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Wait till round 10; Zombies will start to drop a <a href="pictures/main_ee/battery.webp">battery</a>. Pick up a battery and bring it to one of the two radios below. Radio locations:</li>

Once you play all the recordings, the radio will need to rewind (which takes till next round, so end the round to listen again). The radio will talk about one of two things:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A man will talk about how to produce chemicals (this radio can be ignored).</li>
                            <li>A man will talk about whether he thinks a chemical will kill the Radioactive Thing or not. One recording will say something like "I've devised the perfect solution to our mutated crab problem. CHEMICAL NAME!" This is the chemical you need to take note of. The other four recordings will say things like "I don't think CHEMICAL NAME will be useful in the current circumstance," or some other negative comment.</li>
                            <li>One of the negative comments could be understood as positive and that is, "CHEMICAL NAME may be a rather crude solution for what faces us." This is not an indication that the chemical should be used, despite the man saying it would work.</li>
                            <li>Chemical Names:</li>
                            <ul>

                        <li>Once you have the chemical name, change the map colour to the colour from Elvira's TV you got earlier.</li>
                        <li>There are six <a href="pictures/main_ee/board_example.webp">boards around the map with ingredient names and "chemical diamonds"</a> on them.

                                <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/board_power.webp">Power Station - Up the hill toward the Market, on the dirt path behind the Market building</a></li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Once you have all the numbers, you can return to Full Colour. Using <a href="pictures/main_ee/chemicals.webp">this graphic</a>, start at the top with the chemical the radio gave you and work your way backward till you get to a chemical you can make (items in orange are around the map, items in red need to be made).</li>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>So for example, the radio told you to make 1,3,5 tera-nitro-phenol. To make that you need Phenolsulfonic Acid, which you need to make (because it's in red). So to make Phenolsulfonic Acid, you need Phenol. So you'd need to make Phenol, then make Phenolsulfonic Acid, to then make 1,3,5 tera-nitro-phenol. I've highlighted these chemicals because they're in red, meaning they need to be made not found.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>To make a chemical, you need to bring its ingredients (<a href="#ingredients">ingredient locations here</a>) to the chemistry set in the garage, and place them on the <a href="pictures/main_ee/squares_chem.webp">squares in front of the tubes on the table</a>. Then calculate the number to input. The number is calculated by taking the numbers from the board (only the left and top ones on the diamond) for each ingredient and adding them together, then subtracting your O Number.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: Your O Number is 8. To make Phenol, you need Wheel Cleaner, Motor Oil, and Insect Repellent. Wheel Cleaner's numbers are 4 and 7, Motor Oil numbers are 2 and 4, and Insect is 2 and 3. Your final number would be 4 + 7 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 3 - 8 = 14.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Once all your ingredients are placed in the garage, enter your number on the <a href="pictures/main_ee/keypard_number.webp">keypad of the chemistry set</a> by looking at a number's button, and then interacting with it. Once the number is in, press the <a href="pictures/main_ee/big_button.webp">big button</a> to start the reaction.</li>
                        <li>If everything is done correctly, you will get some gas effects on the edges of your screen and the chemical you crafted will spawn on the right side of the garage.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the reaction fails after a couple of seconds, and you take damage, it means your numbers or ingredients were wrong.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Once you have your final chemical (the radio one), pick it up and interact with the Nuke. Once you're ready for the boss fight, all players must interact with the Nuke to start charging it. Once charged, interact with the Nuke to start the Boss Fight.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you can't give the Nuke your chemical, it means you made the wrong one, and need to listen to the radio again to find the right one to make.</li>

                    <ol start="20">
                        <li>Go to the Motel Office and note down the <a href="pictures/main_ee/m_number.webp">"M Number"</a> found on the wall right of the window.</li>
                        <li>On the <a href="pictures/main_ee/elvira_tv.webp">TV beside Elvira in the TV Station</a>, there will be numbers and colours; note down which number is on the top of the TV (should be the "< ##" one).</li>
                        <li>Now enter your M number and the TV number into the solver below. It should return your O Number and a colour option on the TV.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you get an option for the O Number (like "9 or 11"), see Steps 21-23 in <a href="#main_ee_step2_sub1">The Intended Way Section</a> for how to determine the right O Number.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Go to the TV Station and interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/control_panel.webp">control panel</a> to change the map's colour. There are four options for you to change it to, Full Colour (default), Red, Green, and Blue. Change it to the colour on the TV that the solver tells to.</li>
                        <li>Go to Spawn and look at the <a href="pictures/main_ee/board_spawn_full_colour.webp">board in the tent hallway</a>; note down the <a href="pictures/main_ee/chem_diamond_solver.webp">left and top numbers on the diamonds</a> for Insect Repellent and Racing Fuel, while in the colour vision the TV/Solver told you to. Add the numbers from each ingredient's diamond together to be left with one number for each ingredient. Don't add all four numbers together, just add the two from Insect to get the insect number, and the two for Racing Fuel to the Racing Fuel number.</li>
                        <li>Wait till round 10; Zombies will start to drop a <a href="pictures/main_ee/battery.webp">battery</a>. Pick up a battery and bring it to one of the two radios below. Radio locations:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/radio_power.webp">Power Station - On the ground near the porta-potty</a></li>

                        </ul>
                        <li>Interact with the radio to repair it. Interact with it again to play one of its recordings.  You can keep interacting with the radio to play more recordings. Once you play all the recordings, the radio will need to rewind (ending the round makes it rewind). The radio will talk about one of two things:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A man will talk about how to produce chemicals (this radio can be ignored).</li>
                            <li>A man will talk about whether he thinks a chemical will kill the Radioactive Thing or not. One recording will say something like "I've devised the perfect solution to our mutated crab problem. CHEMICAL NAME!" This is the chemical you need to take note of. The other four recordings will say things like "I don't think CHEMICAL NAME will be useful in the current circumstance," or some other negative comment.</li>
                            <li>One of the negative comments could be understood as positive and that is, "CHEMICAL NAME may be a rather crude solution for what faces us." This is not an indication that the chemical should be used, despite the man saying it would work.</li>
                            <li>Chemical Names:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>3,4-di-nitroxy-methyl-propane</li>

                            </ul>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Once you have the M Number, TV number, Insect Repellent and Racing Fuel numbers, and the final chemical from the radio. Input those into the Solver.</li>

            <li>You will be teleported to the Beach, where you have to push the <a href="pictures/main_ee/nuke_cart_spawn.webp">Nuke Cart</a> (by standing near it) to the water. While you're pushing the Nuke, Crog-Zilla will launch Crog eggs and Fireballs at you. It'll do this whenever the nuke stops then starts moving again. Zombies will also start spawning.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The eggs and fireballs can be shot out of the sky. Doing this will allow you to keep the nuke moving (because you won't have to move away from it, which will stop it moving). This means that Crog-Zilla won't fire more eggs/fireballs (because it only fires whenever the nuke stops moving).</li>
            </ul>
            <li>As a side note: A <a href="pictures/main_ee/max_ammo_boss_fight.webp">Max Ammo will spawn near the OSA wallbuy</a> when the boss fight starts. After being picked up, it will respawn after a couple minutes, so don't save it.</li>
            <li>Once the Nuke reaches the water, it will stop moving, and launch into Crog-Zilla's mouth.</li>
            <li>Crog-Zilla will now get new attacks such as its insta-kill ground slam (indicated by raising either one or both claws), and laser beam (the antenna thing on its head will glow).</li>
            <ul>
                <li>To avoid the ground slam, run from the area you're currently in (example, if you're on the elevated area near the OSA wallbuy, run across the bridge toward the RV Park. Tip: Keep moving until it slams its claw(s).</li>
                <li>The laser beam attack, frankly, sucks, and you will not need to move far to avoid it.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>While attacking, a part of Crog-Zilla's <a href="pictures/main_ee/glowing_spot.webp">chest will glow</a>. Using the death rays around the Beach, you will need to shoot the chest. After one successful hit (indicated by a skull icon), the chest will stay glowing, and you can attack it whenever. Once the chest is hit once, you can also shoot the chest with the Spartan SA3 (there is a <a href="pictures/main_ee/spartan_wallbuy.webp">wallbuy</a> near where the Nuke spawned) to do damage without using a Death Ray. Death Ray locations:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/ray_osa.webp">Beside the OSA Wallbuy</a></li>

                <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/ray_bridge.webp">On the big concrete bridge</a></li>
            </ul>
            <li>After hitting the chest 3-4 times, the glowing part will disappear, and Crog-Zilla will stop attacking. All players must interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/nuke_cart_empty.webp">Nuke Cart</a> to start charging it.</li>
            <li>Crog-Zilla will now <a href="pictures/main_ee/raditation_spit.webp">"spit" radiation</a> onto the front part of the beach. Standing in this radiation will do damage to you. Crog-Zilla will then shoot two sets of eggs/fireballs. After the two sets, Crog-Zilla will spit more radiation.</li>
            <li>You must defend yourself against Zombies and Crogs until the radiation makes it under the bridge, pushing you up against a wall. After the set of two eggs, the radiation will clear and lasers will spawn. All players must jump and slide to avoid the lasers to make it to the Nuke cart. There is a timer, so go through the obstacle course quickly, but don't rush yourself and make mistakes; the timer is loose enough to allow you to take your time with the more challenging jumps/slides. Try to always be moving.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If a player doesn't make it to the Nuke in time, the lasers will disappear, then you'll have to interact with the Nuke cart again. Crog-Zilla will spit radiation again, but this time only one set of eggs will be launched per spit, making this go by a lot quicker.</li>
                <li><a href="https://youtu.be/WyuYjiJlzaI">Video of all of the routes to get through the lasers (YouTube)</a></li>
            </ul>
            <li>When all players have interacted with the Nuke after making it through the lasers, you will be brought into Crog-Zilla's belly.

        <h2>Skull Hop</h2>
        <p class="weapon-desc">Skull Hop is an arcade game where players must clear skulls by firing cubes at them. To unlock the machine, you need to complete a specific set of side tasks to get six skulls. Completing the game unlocks all perks permanently (except Up & Atoms in Solo), and unlimited F&F card refills for the remainder of the game.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>There is a <strong>progression-stopping bug</strong> where if you die/lose during the Skull Hop mini-game, you will not be allowed to retry. To avoid this, you will need to use the Skull Hacker F&F Card after you complete Skull 5. After using the card, enter the mini-game, and lose on purpose (by falling off three times). Once you're kicked out, you should be able to retry and lose as many times as you want, like normal. </li>
            <li>Before you start, make sure your TF-141 sniper rifle is either using the default or variable zoom scope, since you need to shoot some things far away and the TF-141 has a wallbuy in the Motel area.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>You can use <a href="https://www.zombacus.com/zombiecalculator">this website (Zombacus)</a> to calculate the number of Zombies in each round. This makes it easier to know how many Zombies you need to kill to be left with the number you need to kill with the trap. For example, Round 10 has 33 Zombies, so you need to kill 17 Zombies to be left with 16. When using the website, Infinite Warfare is considered to have a "Normal" spawn system. The website doesn't factor in special rounds (like the Crog rounds), so the numbers on those rounds will not be correct.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>If only 16 Zombies die in the pool, the completion sound will play once the trap ends.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="side_ee_step4">Skull 4/6 - Word Puzzle</p>
            <li>On the wall of the Ice Cream Parlour, you will see a <a href="pictures/skull_hop/skull_4/word.webp">word/words written on the wall</a> above the bench near the UDM wallbuy; note it down. In front of the swingset near the Parlour, there will be four symbols (<a href="pictures/skull_hop/skull_4/swing_1.webp">Swingset 1</a> and
                <a href="pictures/skull_hop/skull_4/swing_2.webp">Swingset 2</a>). You must spell out the word from the wall by creating combinations of the swingset letters (see How to Solve for detailed solving steps or the Automatic Solver below). As you interact with the letters, they will be added to the <a href="pictures/skull_hop/skull_4/bottom_symbols.webp">bottom of the projection screen</a>. When you have the correct combination, shoot the rightmost symbol on the <a href="pictures/skull_hop/skull_4/top_symbols.webp">top of the projection</a> screen to "lock in" that letter. Only four symbols can be on the bottom row, so to reset the bottom row, add four symbols to the bottom, then interact with a fifth symbol. This will remove the previous four symbols, and make the fifth symbol the first.</li>

            <li>There are four <a href="pictures/skull_hop/skull_5/wyler_portrait_example.webp">Willard Wyler portraits</a> around the map. Place the container on the floor in front of one of the portraits, then interact with the portrait. This will spawn a bubble around you that will slow any Zombies that enter. Melee the container on the ground to spawn the <a href="pictures/skull_hop/skull_5/ghost.webp">"Ghosts."</a> You must shoot at least seven of these Ghosts before the bubble disappears. The Ghosts like to hang out behind you, so if you do see any for a while try turning around.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you don't shoot enough ghosts, you can go back to the pool, get another canister, and try again immediately.</li>
                <li>If you exit the bubble, the Ghost will start to move alot faster. Shooting a ghost out of the bubble will cause them all to despawn. You can retry with a new canister as soon as the current bubble is gone.</li>
                <li>If you bought the S-Ravage, use it to shoot the ghosts, since it one-shots them.</li>
                <li>Portrait locations: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="pictures/skull_hop/skull_5/wyler_gas.webp">Behind the Gas Station</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/skull_hop/skull_5/wyler_market.webp">In the backroom of the Market with the safe</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/skull_hop/skull_5/wyler_ice_cream.webp">In the Ice Cream Parlour</a></li>

                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>When the bubble disappears, and you've shot enough ghosts, you will hear a "success"/pick-up sound, and you will not be able to activate that Wyler portrait again. You will have to pick up another container from the pool and do the same at one of the other portraits.</li>
            <li>After completing the last portrait, you may or may not hear a completion sound (bug maybe). You can check if you did it or not, by checking for Skull 5 on the Skull Hop machine. Also, after completing one or all of the portraits, the ghosts may still be floating around you, ignore them, there's nothing for you to do with them, and it's probably a bug that they don't despawn.</li>


            <p class="step-group-title" id="side_ee_step6">Skull 6/6 - Shoot the machine with the M.A.D.</p>
            <li>Shoot the <a href="pictures/skull_hop/skull_hop_machine.webp">Skull Hop machine</a> with a charged upgraded M.A.D. shot. The M.A.D. can only be obtained from the Magic Wheel. See
                <a href="#mad_upgrade">here</a> how to upgrade it (you only need the crank upgrade).</li>
            <ul>
                <li>There is a <strong>progression-stopping bug</strong> where if you die/lose during the Skull Hop mini-game, you will not be allowed to retry. To avoid this, you will need to use the Skull Hacker F&F Card after you complete Skull 5. After using the card, enter the mini-game, and lose on purpose (by falling off three times). Once you're kicked out, you should be able to retry and lose as many times as you want, like normal.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="side_ee_step7">The Skull Hop Mini-Game</p>
            <li>The game consists of three rounds, with each round requiring you to destroy all the skulls before they make it to the end. In this one, on either side of the Skulls, there will be <a href="pictures/skull_hop/coloured_lines.webp">two coloured lines</a>. These indicate the colour cube you need to shoot at the skulls to destroy them. There are eight different colour moving platforms; when standing on one, the cube you grab will change to that colour.</li>
            <li> Using the Entangler (your gun), grab a cube floating around and shoot it at a skull while the colour bars are the same as the platform you're standing on to destroy it.</li>
            <li>When the colour bars start flashing, it means the colour is about to change, so stop shooting cubes and wait to see what colour it changes to, then go to that platform.</li>
            <li>If you hit a skull with the wrong colour cube or fall off a platform, a skull will turn red and start flying to the vortex behind you. You can shoot a red cube at this skull before it makes it to the end to stop it from escaping. If it makes it to the vortex, you will get a strike. If you get three strikes, the game will end, and you will have to shoot the machine with the MAD again.</li>
            <li>Once all three rounds are completed, you will be teleported back to the Ice Cream Parlour, with all perks permanently (except Up & Atoms in Solo), and unlimited F&F card refills for the remainder of the game.</li>

                <li>Lore fact: This is the same turnstile in the Shaolin Shuffle main quest, and The Beast From Beyond turnstile side easter egg. The "lore" is that you grab it in Beast and try to send it to Shaolin. However, it gets "rerouted" to Attack, so you have to go to Attack and send it to Shaolin, so it can be used in the Shaolin EE.
