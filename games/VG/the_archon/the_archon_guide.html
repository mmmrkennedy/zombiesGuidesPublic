                <li>Interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/resilience_obelisk.webp">Obelisk</a> to start the Trial Of Resilience.</li>
                <li>The player must destroy <a href="pictures/main_ee/resilience_syphoncore.webp">Syphoncores</a> using the Decimator Shield's special ability (Slam) and deliver Demon Blood to the <a href="pictures/main_ee/resilience_emptyfountain.webp">empty Demonic Fountain</a>.

                <li>If the torches are lit at the same time, a <a href="pictures/main_ee/sacrifice_redorb.webp">red orb</a> will spawn near the third torch.</li>
                <li>The orb will request the player to sacrifice a Pack-a-Punched weapon (there is no way to get this weapon back). The best option is to either find a blue (PAP level 1) wallbuy or try to get a Pack-a-Punched weapon from the box and sacrifice that as it is cheaper than upgrading a weapon with the Pack-a-Punch Machine.</li>
                <li>After sacrificing the weapon, you will lose all your armour and an Uberkrieger will spawn.</li>
                <li>Once killed, the orb will move to the <a href="pictures/main_ee/sacrifice_obelisk.webp">Obelisk</a>, which can be interacted with.</li>
                <li>To complete the trial, you will need the Ring of Fire Field Upgrade. There is a <a href="pictures/main_ee/sacrifice_tablet.webp">stone next to where the orb was</a> that will allow you to change your field upgrade into Ring of Fire.</li>
                <li>Interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/sacrifice_obelisk.webp">Obelisk</a> to start the Trial of Sacrifice.</li>
                <li>At any time during the trial, the player can kill five zombies near the Obelisk to spawn a Full Power.</li>
                <li>Several other Obelisks will spawn around the area. You must get six kills near each of the Obelisks while standing in the Ring of Fire.</li>
                <li>Once an obelisk is charged, a <a href="pictures/main_ee/sacrifice_beamoflight.webp">beam of light</a> will connect it to the central obelisk.</li>
                <li>Once all the obelisks are charged, bonus points, full armour, max ammo and full power drops will spawn.</li>

                <p class="boss-fight-phases">Phase 2</p>
                <li>Shoot the <a href="pictures/main_ee/darkaethercrystals.webp">Dark Aether crystals</a> found on the ground around the area to spawn a <a href="pictures/main_ee/crystalshard.webp">red Crystal Shard</a>.</li>

                <li>Throw the blue shard at one of the <a href="pictures/main_ee/pillarinsky.webp">floating pillars in the sky</a>. The pillar will crash into the Construct, disabling Kortifex's bubble shield allowing the player to shoot his two other eyes.</li>
                <li>Once another one of Kortifex's eyes is destroyed, the third phase will begin and the player will be teleported to another area.</li>

                <li>The third phase is identical to the second phase, except this time Kortifex can heal himself.</li>
                <li>To stop Kortifex from healing, hit him with the floating pillars in the sky.</li>
                <li>Once the final eye is destroyed, a short conversation will play and the players will be awarded the following rewards: the calling card "There Archon Be Only One" as well as the Wunderwaffe DG-2, five Sacrificial Hearts, and one tier upgrade for the perks the player had during the fight.</li>
