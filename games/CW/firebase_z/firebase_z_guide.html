    <h2>RAI K-84</h2>
    <p class="weapon-desc">The RAI K-84 is an energy-based AK-47 that has two firing modes and can be Pack-a-Punched.</p>
    <p class="weapon-desc">The Main Firing Mode shoots high-power energy shots, which are similar to the Raygun's shots. The Alt Fire Mode is an under-barrel Grenade Launcher that shoots an energy mine, similar to the Energy Mine Field Upgrade, that explodes after being shot multiple times by the Main Fire.</p>
    <p class="weapon-desc">The RAI K-84 is available from the mystery box, through the completion of trials, and via the following quest: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Go to 'Weapon Lab' and pick up the <a href="pictures/raik84/blueprint.webp">RAI K-84 Blueprint</a>.</li>
      <li>Go to the 'Scorched Defense' and interact with the <a href="pictures/raik84/tank_body.webp">corpse by the tank</a> to get the eye.</li>
      <li>Once you have the eye, the following parts (Barrel Assembly, Charged Power Cell, Aetherium Converter) can be obtained in any order/simultaneously.</li>

      <p class="step-group-title">Barrel Assembly</p>
      <li>Go back to the 'Weapon Lab' and interact with the <a href="pictures/raik84/scanner.webp">Retina Scanner</a> to open the drawer below the computer. Pick up the key from the drawer.</li>
      <li>In 'Barracks 1' and 'Barracks 2', there are lockers that, when opened, may spawn a mimic.</li>
      <li>If a Mimic does spawn, kill it and check if it dropped the Barrel Assembly. If it didn't drop the Barrel Assembly, keep opening lockers and killing mimics till it drops.</li>

      <p class="step-group-title">Charged Power Cell</p>
      <li>Wait for a Mangler to spawn. Kill it and see if it dropped the Charged Power Cell. If it didn't, you have to wait for another one to spawn.</li>
      <li>Once you have the Charged Power Cell, return to the 'Weapon Lab' and interact with <a href="pictures/raik84/powercell.webp">this computer</a> to charge the cell. Wait a full round then come back and pick it up.</li>

      <p class="step-group-title">Aetherium Converter</p>
      <li>Go to the 'Weapon Lab' and interact with the computer. It will display a circle which is divided into several triangles, this <a href="pictures/raik84/dartboard_ref.webp">represents a dart board.</a> The lit triangle will start moving, take note of where it stops as these are the numbers you will need.</li>
      <li>In the 'Village', just to the left of the wunderfizz, there is a <a href="pictures/raik84/dartboard.webp">dart board</a>. You must shoot the three numbers (the actual numbers on the board, not the part you would hit if you were playing darts) then shoot the bullseye. The dart board will open and the Aetherium Converter will fly onto the ground.</li>

      <p class="step-group-title">Crafting the Weapon</p>
      <li>Go back to the 'Weapon Lab' and craft the RAI-K 84 where you picked up the blueprint, left of the Computer.</li>
    </ol>

  <!-- Main Easter Egg -->
  <div class="content-container" id="main_ee">
    <h2>'Maxis Potential' Main Quest</h2>
    <p class="stats">Stats (Solo): Difficulty - 4/10, Est Completion Time - 40 Mins to 1 Hr, RNG Rating - 0/5</p>
    <ol class="step-content">
      <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step1">Prerequisites</p>
      <li>Activate Pack-a-Punch.</li>
      <p class="warning">Note: The RAI K-84 is required for the Easter Egg, but not until <a href="#main_ee_step4">step 16</a>.</p>
      <li>In the 'Atrium' (Pack-a-Punch room), speak to Ravenov, then go to 'Mission Control' and speak to <a href="pictures/main_ee/prerequisites/pecksroom.webp">Dr. Peck</a>. Then go back to the 'Atrium' and speak to Ravenov again. He will give you his ID Badge. </li>

      <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step2">Creating the Serum</p>
      <li>Once you pick up the ID Badge, use it to open three lockers and collect the compounds in each. Locations: </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Equipment Storage - <a href="pictures/main_ee/creating_the_serum/chem_spawn.webp">In the room to the right of Quick Revive</a></li>
        <li>Engineering - <a href="pictures/main_ee/creating_the_serum/chem_eng.webp">From the teleporter from spawn, the area on the left</a></li>
        <li>Colonel's Office - <a href="pictures/main_ee/creating_the_serum/chem_office.webp">The office above jug</a></li>
      </ul>
      <li>Go to 'Field Hospital' and interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/creating_the_serum/chem_mixer.webp">Chemical Mixer</a>. This will spawn some hellhounds, and kill them.</li>
      <li>Interact with the Chemical Mixer again and pick up the <a href="pictures/main_ee/creating_the_serum/agent_delivery_system.webp">Agent Delivery System</a> left of the Chemical Mixer.</li>
      <li>Go to the 'OPC' and interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/creating_the_serum/chem_acunit.webp">Air Conditioner Unit</a> to place the Agent Delivery System. This will fill Peck's room with gas.</li>

      <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step3">Collect the Mimic's Memories</p>
      <li>Keep interacting with Peck until Weaver says, "Alright, Peck. You've had your fun..."</li>
      <li>Go to the 'Data Center' and interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/collect_the_mimic_memories/mimic_trapstation.webp">Memory Transference Station</a>. Pick up one of the Essence Traps.</li>
      <li>In the locations below, there might be a Mimic hiding as loot. You must capture the Mimic in an Essence Trap.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Damage the Mimic until it has about 10% health remaining, then throw the essence trap on the ground. Once the Mimic is standing on the trap, double-tap the interact button to activate the trap. If the Mimic is low enough health, it will stay trapped, and you will be able to pick the trap back up. If the Mimic has too much health, it will pop out of the trap, and you will have to get a new trap to try again.</li>
        <li>Only one location will have a Mimic per round.</li>
        <li>If you accidentally kill the Mimic or can't find it, end the round far from where you are trying to get a Mimic to spawn and come back next round. The Mimic only seems to spawn when no players are nearby at the start of a round. If it didn't spawn back, check one of the other locations or try again next round.</li>
        <li>Mimic Locations: </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Motor Pool - <a href="pictures/main_ee/collect_the_mimic_memories/mimic_motorpool.webp">From the teleporter from spawn, the area on the right</a></li>
          <li>Sky Bridge/Military Command Control Room - <a href="pictures/main_ee/collect_the_mimic_memories/mimic_jugroom.webp">Jug Room/The Bridge above Jug</a></li>
          <li>Peck's Quarters - <a href="pictures/main_ee/collect_the_mimic_memories/mimic_spawnlocation.webp">Above Pack-a-Punch on the right in the room with the Bulldog wallbuy</a></li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Once you collect a Mimic, you have 3 minutes to deposit the trap at the <a href="pictures/main_ee/collect_the_mimic_memories/mimic_trapstation.webp">Memory Transference Station</a>. If you collect the right Mimic, either <strong>Brahms, Sokolov or Zhabin</strong> will start speaking.</li>
      <li>Once you've heard from Brahms, Sokolov and Zhabin, the Memory Transference Station will eject a floppy disk for you to pick up.</li>

      <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step4">Stabilize the Breach</p>
      <li>Go to the 'Planning Office' and insert the floppy disk into <a href="pictures/main_ee/stabilize_the_breach/breach_floppyinsert.webp">this Computer</a>. This will open the door to the OPC; enter it to spawn a dimensional breach.</li>
      <li>When the PA system says "Attention: membrane instability detected. Stabilization required", talk to Dr. Peck.</li>
      <li>After Dr. Peck is finished talking, Ravenov will give you a code, and interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/stabilize_the_breach/locker_peck.webp">Locker Left of Peck's Room</a> to open it. Pick up the Aethermeter from the locker.</li>
      <li>Go to 'Scorched Defence' and pick up the <a href="pictures/main_ee/stabilize_the_breach/shovel.webp">Shovel</a> from the <a href="pictures/main_ee/stabilize_the_breach/shovel_room.webp">Bunker on the Left</a>.</li>
      <li>You must now dig up three Aether Crystals located in the locations below. Each crystal has a small "minigame" associated with it.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Open Lot: </li>
        <ol>
          <li>Dig up the <a href="pictures/main_ee/stabilize_the_breach/container_lot.webp">Container near the window to Engineering</a>. Interact with the container to start the minigame.</li>
          <li>When you interact with the container, it will disappear and several containers will spawn around the area.</li>
          <li>You must find and interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/stabilize_the_breach/container_noblack.webp">Container with no black particles</a>.</li>
          <li>All the other containers in the area contain <a href="pictures/main_ee/stabilize_the_breach/container_black.webp">Black Particles</a>.</li>
          <li>If you interact with an incorrect container, kill the Mimics that spawn and end the round to respawn the containers to try again.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Jungle Defence: </li>
        <ol>
          <li>Dig up the container in the <a href="pictures/main_ee/stabilize_the_breach/container_jungle.webp">Middle Lane</a> where zombies spawn during the defence.</li>
          <li>A dome will spawn that you must survive inside until it disappears. Once the dome is gone, you will be able to pick up the container.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Barracks: </li>
        <ol>
          <li>Obtain the <a href="#raik84">RAI K-84</a>.</li>
          <li>Dig up the container near the <a href="pictures/main_ee/stabilize_the_breach/container_hospital.webp">Door of the Field Hospital</a> closest to the stairs going to the 'Data Center'.</li>
          <li>The container will then teleport to a random location in and around the 'Barracks' and 'Field Hospital'.</li>
          <li>Once you locate the container, avoid approaching it and instead shoot it with the RAI K-84's Alt Fire Mode to stop it from moving. While the container is affected by the RAI K-84, pick it up.</li>
          <li>If you fail to pick up the container quickly enough or get too close, it will teleport to a new location, where you can repeat the above.</li>
        </ol>
      </ul>
      <li>Once you collect all three containers, interact with each of the three Aether Reactors around the base. Locations: </li>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/stabilize_the_breach/container_militarycommand.webp">Military Command</a></li>
        <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/stabilize_the_breach/container_missioncontrol.webp">Mission Control</a></li>
        <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/stabilize_the_breach/container_datacenter.webp">Data Center</a></li>
      </ul>
      <li>In the 'Planning Office', interact with <a href="pictures/main_ee/stabilize_the_breach/sat.webp">this computer</a>. Move the marker to the yellow dot that shows a question mark instead of either the US or USSR flag. Press interact to confirm alignment.</li>

      <p class="warning">Warning: Point of No Return. Once you interact with the Terminal, you will be put into the Boss Fight</p>
      <li>Return to the OPC and interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/stabilize_the_breach/terminal.webp">Terminal</a> to begin a cutscene.</li>

      <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step5">Orda Boss Fight</p>
      <li>You will be teleported to spawn where you must fight Orda.</li>
      <li>Shoot Orda till its health bar hits 0. Orda's mouth is a critical damage point when it is orange.</li>
      <li>Avoid getting near Orda as it has an attack where it slams its arm on the ground which can one-hit down you.</li>
      <li>You still have access to Pack-a-Punch, Wunderfizz, Workbench, and the Armoury station making this boss fight straightforward.</li>
