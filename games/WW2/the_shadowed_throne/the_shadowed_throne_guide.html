                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Go to 'Main Street,' and look at the
                        <a href="pictures/wunderbuss/radio_code.webp">code on the top</a>
                        of the

                        . The code will be two letters, a dash, then a number.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the 'Church,' there are
                        <a href="pictures/wunderbuss/papers_church.webp">two pieces of paper on the wall right of the Mystery Box</a>
                        . These are a list of radio frequencies and a map. Look at the map and find the location the pin is on. Then, using this location and the code from the Radio, find the band and frequency in the list of frequencies.
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The list of frequencies doesn't change, so you can use
                            <a href="pictures/wunderbuss/frequencies.webp">this image</a>
                            for quick reference or to guess.
                        </li>
                        <li>Example: Your Radio code is "TX-3". The map says "Barnim," so you find Barnim in the list. Then, in the Barnim section, look for the number associated with "TX"; which would be "26.5." Then look for the number associated with "3"; which would be "50.1."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Once you have the two numbers, go back to the Radio on 'Main Street' and interact with it. You will be able to enter the numbers into the Radio by spinning the thumbsticks on controller or Strafe (A, D) and Fire/ADS (Mouse 1, 2) on PC to move the needle pointing to a number. Enter the first number into the left dial, and the second into the right.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Radio is pretty forgiving on how accurate you have to be. The dials can be slightly off (~1-2 numbers of margin) and still count.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>If done correctly, a light on the Radio will turn green, a man will speak to you, and "Contacted the Russians" will appear on your screen.</li>
                    <li>
                        Head to the 'Plaza,' and shoot the
                        <a href="pictures/wunderbuss/wooden_box.webp">lock on the wooden box</a>
                        left of the door to the 'Museum.' The box will open; shoot it again to launch a flare. This will get the attention of Straub's Zeppelin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the Zeppelin tethers itself, it will fire a "Geistbolt" at any undamaged Zombie. This will turn the Zombie into a

                    <ul>
                        <li>Sizzlers are extremely fast Zombies that do normal damage; they will catch you while sprinting, but they don't gain more health, so they're pretty easy to kill.</li>
                        <li>The Zeppelin will create a Sizzler every couple of minutes. You can avoid Sizzlers spawns (if you want to leave last, for example) by damaging the Zombie; damaged Zombies can't become Sizzlers.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Melee kill a Sizzler to get a Geistbolt.</li>

                    <li>
                        Once you have the battery and the Geistbolt, head to the basement of the 'Apartments,' and place the battery in the

                        to open the gates. Enter the previously fenced off room, and grab the battery from inside the room; this will close the gate, locking you in.

                    <li>
                        Once you're ready for the Boss Fight (see below for tips for before you start), all players must have a Wunderbuss with full ammo. Enter the Drop Pod on 'Main Street'; all players must shoot the
                        <a href="pictures/main_ee/cable_drop_pod.webp">cable at the top of the Drop Pod</a>
                        at the same time. This will start raising the Drop Pod up to the Zeppelin.

                    <ul>
                        <li>I recommend you use the Dancer's Dagger instead of the Blade for the Boss Fight because you can get armour back with the heavy attack with the Dagger if you're at full health.</li>
                        <li>Also, I recommend you get either the MP40 (Main Street) or FG42 (Church) and Pack-a-Punch it. The Boss Fight is long, and ammo is scarce, but there is a wallbuy for the MP40 and FG42 in the arena, so you can buy ammo when necessary, instead of waiting for a max ammo power-up.</li>

                    <li>
                        Once you're in the Zeppelin, the Boss Fight won't start right away. You have to move a
                        <a href="pictures/main_ee/power_ball.webp">"power ball"</a>
                        in the floor around to open all the gates, then into Straub's room at the end of the Zeppelin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To move the ball, there will be
                        <a href="pictures/main_ee/terminal.webp">interactive terminals</a>
                        scattered throughout the Zeppelin. When you interact with a terminal, you will see multiple nodes connected wires. Note that each terminal has limited movement capabilities, indicated by the green or red wires connecting the nodes. On any given terminal, you can only move the ball between nodes connected by green wires.
                    </li>
                    <li>Throughout the Zeppelin, there are gates; you should open all of them, because it'll help when training in the Boss Fight. Once you move the ball up the stairs, there are two paths to move it. Take it up first, open all the gates in that direction, then take the down path. This is because moving down is the intended path, so moving up first will save you a "trip."</li>
                    <li>Once all the gates are open, guide the power source into the room where Dr. Straub is located. Once the power source reaches Straub's room, the wave will end, and he will be killed by Zombies.</li>
                    <li>Exit the room, and the Stadtjäger will drop, signalling the start of the boss fight.</li>

                    <li>Shoot the Stadtjäger to aggravate him. When aggravated, the engine on his chest will glow orange, and he will charge at you. While the engine is orange, you will be able to shoot and deal damage to him.</li>
                    <li>There are no indicators you're doing damage (no hitmarkers, bullets phase through him, etc.) so keep shooting at the engine will the phase end.</li>
                    <li>Once you have dealt enough damage, this phase will end, indicated by the Stadtjäger "injecting" himself with a Geistbolt.</li>

                    <p class="boss-fight-phases">Phase 2</p>
                    <li>Now, the Stadtjäger will occasionally make Sizzlers by throwing Geistbolts. You can only damage him when he's doing this instead of when he's charging. The Stadtjäger will still charge, but you won't be able to do damage.</li>
                    <li>Once you have dealt enough damage, this phase will end, indicated by the Stadtjäger "injecting" himself with another Geistbolt.</li>

                    <p class="boss-fight-phases">Phase 3</p>
                    <li>Now, the Stadtjäger will occasionally produce a cloud of gas. You need to shoot the gas (with any weapon, but Wunderbuss is recommended) while the Stadtjäger is standing in it.</li>
                    <li>Once you have dealt enough damage, this phase will end, indicated by the Stadtjäger "injecting" himself with another Geistbolt. This time, however, he'll die.</li>
                    <li>Enter the Drop Pod you entered on. It will close, and you'll be brought back to the street. After a couple of seconds, the cutscene will start.</li>
