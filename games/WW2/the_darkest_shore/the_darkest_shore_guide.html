            <li>Once you open the first door and enter the 'Bluffs' or 'U-Boat Pens,' Fog can start rolling in.</li>
            <li>In the Fog, a few extra Zombies will start spawning. Zombies will not chase the player by default, instead just wandering around. The Zombies can be alerted by a player getting too close, or firing their weapon.</li>
            <li>In every Fog except the first one, a <a href="pictures/fog/meuchler.webp">Meuchler</a> will spawn. The Meuchler is a large "boss" Zombie that can (and will) chase the player in and out of the Fog. The Meuchler does heavy damage (75-85% of max health) when it swings at you. The Meuchler is also "smart," it will try to flank you, avoid traps if possible, and "respawn" itself (by climbing into a hole) and pop out somewhere else. They do make a pretty loud clicking noise, which can help you spot one if you're inside, and don't see the Fog.</li>
            <li>If you don't kill the Meuchler by the time the Fog lifts, the Meuchler will run away and despawn (until the next Fog).</li>
            <li>There is no special bonus for killing a Meuchler, so due to the way it works, you can keep running from it until the Fog lifts to avoid fighting it.</li>

                <li>A charged spine will be indicated by the glowing battery on the spine during the pullout animation.

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step2">Corpse Gate</p>
            <li>Shoot the head off the <a href="pictures/main_ee/hanging_man.webp">hanging corpse in 'Bunker 3.'</a> It will drop for you to pick it up.</li>
            <li>Place the head on the <a href="pictures/main_ee/corpse_gate.webp">headless corpse (Corpse Gate)</a> in the 'U-Boat Pens.'</li>
            <li>Get about 10 kills next to the Corpse Gate. When you’ve gotten enough kills, some dialogue will play, and you will be locked in the 'U-Boat Pens' with some of the floor tiles randomly shooting fire.</li>
            <li>In three corners of the 'U-Boat Pens,' there are three <a href="pictures/main_ee/gas_valve.webp">gas valves</a> (on either side of the Corpse Gate, and left of the stairs) that need to be deactivated. The tiles below the valves will always be on fire unlike the other tiles. Randomly, one of the valve's tiles will go out, indicted by a gas turning off sound. You can then turn off that valve.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you're too slow, the fire will reappear under the valve, and you must wait until it has gone again.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once you've turned off all the valves, the fire will go away, and you’re able to interact with the Corpse Gate. The man will be ripped in half, and the door behind will open to reveal the Freezer area. Once the door has fully opened, a Brenner zombie will spawn. Killing the Brenner will drop a Max Ammo power-up that doesn't despawn, so you can leave it until you need it (keep it for the Boss Fight).</li>
            <li>Make your way to an outside area of the map. Planes will start flying around, shooting at you. Using any of the <a href="pictures/main_ee/aa_gun.webp">Anti-Air guns</a> around the Bunker area, shoot down about three waves of planes (until "Shot down the German Fighter Planes" appears on screen).</li>
            <ul>

                    <li>Give it to the <a href="pictures/main_ee/monk_machine_with_head.webp">Monk in the Freezer</a>. After a couple of seconds, a friendly Zombie will spawn, and start running to the Beach. He can be attacked, so make sure to defend him.</li>
                    <li>Once he reaches the Beach, he will run into the water. After a few seconds, he'll come back carrying a Son statue. He'll walk onto the beach and die, dropping the <a href="pictures/main_ee/son2.webp">Son for you to pick up</a>.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>3rd Son:</li>

                <li>All players must go to the secret room. Once all players are in the room, the door will close and three Wustlings will fall from the ceiling. Kill them and pick up the head one of them drops. One of the Wustlings will have more health than a normal one.</li>

                <li>Once the Pest has been charged five times, it will drop dead.</li>
                <li>All players must go to the secret room. Once all players are in the room, the door will close and about 5-10 Pests will fall from the ceiling. Kill them and pick up the head one of them drops.</li>
            </ol>

            <li>Once you have three heads from the rituals, pick up the Monk Head from the machine in the Freezer. Place the heads on the <a href="pictures/main_ee/hooks.webp">four hooks hanging from the ceiling in the secret room</a>. The door will close, and you will need to fill the sunken middle area of the floor with blood by killing Zombies anywhere in the room (~50-75 Zombie kills needed). The Zombies should start infinitely spawning.</li>
            <li>Once you get enough kills, the animal skull the statue is holding will explode, revealing the <a href="pictures/main_ee/pommel.webp">Pommel of Barbarossa</a>.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The Pommel is a tactical grenade that, when thrown, creates an initial explosion that instantly kills zombies, followed by an energy bubble, then another explosion. The Pommel regenerates in about 10–15 seconds. If you wish to have the Jack-in-the-Boxes for the Boss Fight, you will need to get them from the Box just before the Boss fight, because the Pommel is needed just before you start the Fight.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step5">Bomber Escort and Destroying Ships</p>
            <li>Interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/bomber_spawner.webp">machine on the right in the Freezer</a>. This will spawn a friendly Bomber that you need to escort to the 'Artillery Bunker.' The Bomber has little health, so you need to defend it from the Zombies.</li>
            <li>Once the Bomber makes it to the 'Artillery Bunker,' it will deposit the battery into a receptacle, and die.</li>
            <li>You now need to charge the battery by getting kills near it. You need about 5 kills for one cannon shot; you will need at least two. The cannon can hold six shots at once.</li>
            <li>Once the cannon is sufficiently charged, go the 'Bunkers' and pick up the <a href="pictures/main_ee/radio_corpse.webp">Radio Part on the floor next to the corpse</a> right of the Combat Shotgun wallbuy.</li>
            <li>Go to the 'Bluffs.' Above the doorway to 'Bunker 3' (above Electric Cherry), there will be a <a href="pictures/main_ee/radio_pilot.webp">man dangling holding a radio</a>. Shoot the arm of the man with the Ripsaw to make it fall to the floor for you to pick up.</li>
            <li>Go to the 'Overlook' and interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/radio_mystery_box.webp">Radio on the table</a>, right of the Mystery Box.</li>
            <li>This will play a long bit of dialogue, followed by Destroyer boats firing on the island from the water in front of the cannon. You need to use the cannon to destroy the ships (two total, one at a time). To aim the cannon, interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/cannon_elevation.webp">left panel</a> to change the elevation, and the <a href="pictures/main_ee/cannon_angle.webp">right panel</a> to change the angle. Use <a href="pictures/main_ee/cannon_aiming_guide.webp">this aiming guide image</a> to help you aim the cannon. Interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/cannon_fire_button.webp">button in the middle of the panels</a> to fire.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>To aim without the helper image, you will need to use the charts on the wall, right of the cannon. The top image will tell you the angle and distance in meters. The bottom image will help you convert the distance to the measurement the panel uses (+05, -10, etc.)</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="warning">Warning: Point of No Return. Once the radio is interacted with, the Boss Fight will start.</p>

            <li>Throw the Pommel at the radio you used to call in the British Air Force earlier in the Easter Egg. Then, all players must interact with the radio at the same time. If you wish to get Jack-in-the-Boxes for the Fight, get them after you throw the Pommel at the Radio, but before you interact with it. This is because the Pommel is no longer required for the Quest.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step6">Meistermeuchler Boss Fight</p>
            <li>A short cutscene will play showing the four Meistermeuchlers, each with an ability mimicking the player's special abilities (except Freefire). The purple one (Frontline) will buff nearby Zombies. Green (Camouflage) will temporarily blind players caught in its attack. Red (Shellshock) will send out a shellshock stun attack. Yellow (Freefire) will shoot a saw blade that will bounce off walls.</li>

            <p class="boss-fight-phases">Phase 1</p>
            <li>While on the Beach, the fog will be present, and you will need to fight each of the Meistermeuchlers one at a time.</li>
            <li>Shoot the Meistermeuchler until you stop getting hitmarkers, and it runs away (I'll call this a "kill" for easier description). If you take too long to kill the Meistermeuchler, it will go away on its own and another will take its place. The Meistermeuchler you didn't "kill" will come back after each of the others had their turn.</li>
            <li>After killing each of the four Meistermeuchlers, the fog will lift and the phase will be over. Ride the minecart to the next arena; you will be given a Max Ammo on the minecart ride.</li>

            <p class="boss-fight-phases">Phase 2</p>
            <li>You will be brought to the 'U-Boat Pens,' and a Brenner Zombie will spawn. Also, the "door" out of the Pens will be closed and some of the floor tiles will start shooting fire like the gas valve step earlier in the Quest.</li>
            <li>The phase is the same as the first one except you will need to fight two of the Meistermeuchlers at a time.</li>
            <li>After killing all the Meistermeuchlers, the door out of the arena will open, the fire will stop, and the phase will be over. There will be a Full Meter power-up at the top of the stairs, and you will be able to refill armour at the stand by the Ripsaw table. Ride the minecart to the next arena; you will be given a Max Ammo on the minecart ride.</li>

            <p class="boss-fight-phases">Phase 3</p>
            <li>You will be brought to the 'Bunker 1' area with access to the entire bunker area on the top of the map (from PAP to the Artillery Bunker). Also, the fog will be present.</li>
            <li>The phase is the same as the second one except you will need to fight three of the Meistermeuchlers at a time. You can use the armour stand in the 'Artillery Bunker' at will, so make sure you do.</li>
            <li>After killing all the Meistermeuchlers, the fog will lift and the phase will be over. Make sure to buy armour before you ride the minecart, this will be your last chance to do so. Ride the minecart to the next (and final) arena; you will be given a Max Ammo on the minecart ride.</li>

            <p class="boss-fight-phases">Phase 4</p>
            <li>You will be brought back to the Beach, but the fog won't be present. You will need to fight all the Meistermeuchlers at the same time.</li>
            <li>This time, however, they will actually die, so try to focus one if possible.</li>
            <li>Once the fourth one dies, the boss fight will end and the cutscene will start after a few seconds.</li>
