            <li>Due to the nature of this "map," the Quest is split across three maps. You need to complete one map's quest, then immediately go to the next. Once you complete a map, you'll be sent back to the lobby, where you need to manually select the next map. You can edit loadouts, change characters, etc. before you start the next map. If you leave the lobby, you'll need to restart with Into The Storm (Map 1).</li>
            <li>Also, the Quests have strict wave requirements, meaning steps need to be completed on specific waves, or you'll fail or won't have enough waves left to complete them.</li>

            <li>Do not kill any Wustlings that spawn. You need to have two at the same time.</li>

            <li>During the transition from Wave 5 to 6, lightning will strike the Zombie, and it will fall to the ground.</li>
            <li>During Wave 6, you'll need to get kills near the body to charge it. The Zombie will not stop taking charge, so feed as many Zombies as you can just to be safe. Wave 6 will be a challenge round, so don't finish the challenge (if possible) until the last minute.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>For example: If you get the Repair challenge, repair 2/3 of the items, then spend the rest of the round charging the Zombie. Then, with 20-30 seconds left (or when comfortable), finish the challenge.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="sub-sub-step" id="main_ee_step1.6" data-bool-quick-link="false">Wave 7</p>
            <li>If charged enough, the Zombie will get up and start walking to the broken House, through the Windmill. Defend the Zombie from other Zombies, till it crawls into the <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_1/">debris beside the fireplace</a>.</li>
            
            <p class="sub-sub-step" id="main_ee_step1.7" data-bool-quick-link="false">Wave 8</p>
            <li>The Zombie will emerge from the debris with a battery in one hand. Get kills near the Zombie till the battery is charged and glowing green. Let the Zombies kill the battery Zombie.</li>
            <li>Pick up the battery the Zombie dropped, and place it into the <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_1/">generator in the Wine Cellar</a>.</li>
            <li>This will open the door, revealing the <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_1/">Hilt</a> for you to pick up (and the Sword if you've already completed the Main Quest). Picking up the Hilt will give you all Blitz perks for the remainder of the game.</li>

            <li>Right when you end the round, a <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_2/red_herring.webp">Red Herring will spawn in the air</a>. Follow it to the red floor room. It'll stop and create a <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_2/battery_charging_1.webp">battery charging station</a>.</li>
            <li>Around the map, a battery wallbuy will spawn. You need to buy a battery for 3000 jolts, and place it in the charging station. Wallbuy Locations:</li>

            <li>Melee the <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/">battery in the Forge Room</a> three times to break it. Interacting with this battery on even rounds (2, 4, 6, etc.) will put you in the same vision mode from the previous map, but only for a limited time.</li>

            <li>At the top of the map, there's a wall of runes. You'll need to enter the correct sequence. This can either be done by guessing all the rune combinations on this list, or the intended way of finding the code. If you plan on guessing, go to the next step, otherwise, read below for how to find the code.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Interact with the battery in the Forge Room to enter the vision mode.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you run out of battery time before you find the rune, CHANGE ME.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/rune_locations/">Forge Room - On the underside of the CHANGE ME, left of the battery</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/rune_locations/">Forge Room - Above the LMG wallbuy on the left side of the room</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/rune_locations/">Left Side (of the map) - Above the doorway to the Forge Room</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/rune_locations/">Left Side - At the top right of the stairs from Laufenblitz (Stamin-Up), behind some scaffolding</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/rune_locations/">Left Side - At the top left of the stairs from Laufenblitz (Stamin-Up), on a large rock behind the light</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/rune_locations/">Left Side - Above the first PAP battery, in the Schnellblitz (Speed Cola) room</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/rune_locations/">Left Side - Just up the stairs from the Schnellblitz (Speed Cola) room on the ceiling</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/rune_locations/">Rune Room - At the top of the stairs from the Schnellblitz (Speed Cola) room, right of the CHANGE ME wallbuy, beside a head</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/rune_locations/">Rune Room - On the left wall at the top of the stairs from Schildblitz (Electric Cherry)</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/rune_locations/">Right Side (of the map) - Halfway up the stairs from Schildblitz (Electric Cherry), on the right wall</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/rune_locations/">Right Side - On the wall behind Schildblitz (Electric Cherry)</a></li>

                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Once you have your code (or you plan on guessing), go to the Rune Room at the top of the map. Interact with the runes on the wall in order. If done correctly, the wall will glow with electricity, and a sound will play.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you enter the code wrong (or the wrong one if you're guessing), repeatedly interact with any rune until they all depress into the wall for a few seconds, then comeback out. This will reset the input.</li>
            </ul>
            
            
            <p class="sub-sub-step" id="main_ee_step3.3" data-bool-quick-link="false">Wave 3</p>
            <li>On the transition between rounds, a supply crate will drop through the hole in the ceiling in the Rune room. Inside is the Hilt for you to pick up. Place the Hilt in the <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/">glowing bowl in the Forge Room</a>.</li>

            <li>A <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/">box of flares</a> will spawn on the stairs between the Forge Room and Spawn. Pick up the flares; they'll replace your tactical grenade.</li>
            <li>Throw a flare into each of the four <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/">stone bowls</a> on the walls below the CHANGE ME in the Forge Room. You'll need to grab more flares, since you only have two at a time.</li>
            <li>Once all bowls are lit, there will be a <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/">fire bowl</a> on the ground, left of where the Supply Crates drop near Laufenblitz (Stamin-Up). Throw a flare into it; a <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/">wall left of Laufenblitz will open</a>, revealing a rune for you to pick up.</li>
            <li>Place the new Rune on the Rune wall. You must now find (or guess) a new rune code in the same way as before.</li>
            
            <p class="sub-sub-step" id="main_ee_step3.5" data-bool-quick-link="false">Wave 5</p>
            <li>On the transition between rounds, another supply crate will drop through the hole in the ceiling in the Rune room with the Pommel inside. Place it in the <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/">glowing bowl in the Forge Room</a>.</li>
            <li>Around the map, there are four <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/">Sacrificial Stones on the floor</a>. All players must stand together on any of the stones at the same time and get kills. Once you get enough kills, a sound will play. A rune will be in the blood pool in the Forge Room for you to pick up (it will fall from one of the CHANGE ME, that's dropping blood into the pool).</li>
            <li>Place the Rune on the wall and find/enter the new code.</li>
            
            <p class="sub-sub-step" id="main_ee_step3.6" data-bool-quick-link="false">Wave 6</p>
            <li>On the transition between rounds, another supply crate will drop with the Blade inside. Place it in the <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/">glowing bowl in the Forge Room</a>.</li>
            <li>Interact with the Forge to assemble the Sword. After a couple of seconds, you'll be able to pick up the sword.</li>
            <li>You're now free to complete the map. Upon completion, the cutscene will play, the Sword will be present when you do the Main Quest on any other Tortured Path map, and you'll be able to play on each of the maps in the round-based format.</li>
