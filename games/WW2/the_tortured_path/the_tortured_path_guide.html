        <ol>
            <li>Due to the nature of this "map," the Quest is split across three maps. You need to complete one map's quest, then immediately go to the next. Once you complete a map, you'll be sent back to the lobby, where you need to manually select the next map. You can edit loadouts, change characters, etc. before you start the next map. If you leave the lobby, you'll need to restart with Into The Storm (Map 1).</li>
            <li>Also, the Quests have strict wave requirements, meaning steps need to be completed on specific waves, or you'll fail or won't have enough waves left to complete them.</li>

            <li>Hold interact on the <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_1/branch_in_river.webp">branch in the river</a>, left of Kugelblitz (Double Tap) Machine. The branch will slowly rise out of the water. Once it's all the way up, it'll stop, and you'll be able to pick up the rope on the branch.</li>
            
            <p class="sub-sub-step" id="main_ee_step1.3" data-bool-quick-link="false">Wave 3</p>
            <li>A Drop Pod will fall near the dead cow, left of the Lebenblitz (Quick Revive) Machine. <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_1/drop_pod.webp">Two rods will drop near the pod</a>, one behind the cow, and one in front of the truck. Pick up the rods.</li>
            <li>Progress the waves till you get two Wustlings to spawn. If you don't get it by wave 5, you need to restart.</li>
            
            <p class="sub-sub-step" id="main_ee_step1.4" data-bool-quick-link="false">Wave 5</p>
            <li>Once you have two Wustlings, line them up with one behind the other. Shoot the one in the back so it charges the one in front. If done correctly, the front one will die, dropping his <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_1/club.webp">arm club</a>. Pick it up.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you can't get two wustlings to spawn on wave 5, make sure you've beaten each map at least once. This is what I did before it fixed it, but whether this is what fixed it or not, I don't know for sure.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Place the club in the <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_1/windmill_gears.webp">gears inside the windmill</a> when the <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_1/windmill_blade.webp">longest blade is pointing straight down</a>. If it's in the right place, you'll be able to interact with it to place the Zombie parts. Otherwise, you will need to try again by picking up the club.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The position of the Windmill Blade to place the body needs to be very precise, and it is quite annoying to do Solo. You can see it pass in front of the doorway right before you need to stop it. Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/4fIecw-WNTU?t=250">this video (YouTube)</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CRFX">CienkaRentaFX</a> for a good example of the timing on this.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once the Zombie is on the blade, pick up the club from the gears. Stop the windmill when the <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_1/zombie_highest_point.webp">Zombie Blade is at the highest point</a>. If you count 20 seconds from when you pick up the club, then stop it at 20, you should have it in the right place.</li>
            
            <p class="sub-sub-step" id="main_ee_step1.5" data-bool-quick-link="false">Wave 6</p>
            <li>During the transition from Wave 5 to 6, lightning will strike the Zombie, and it will fall to the ground.</li>
            <li>During Wave 6, you'll need to get kills near the body to charge it. The charge the Zombie takes will make him stronger when you have to defend him later. The Zombie will not stop taking charge, so feed as many Zombies as you can just to be safe. Wave 6 will be a challenge round, so don't finish the challenge (if possible) until the last minute.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>For example, if you get the Repair challenge, repair 2/3 of the items, then spend the rest of the round charging the Zombie. Then, with 20-30 seconds left (or when comfortable), finish the challenge.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="sub-sub-step" id="main_ee_step1.6" data-bool-quick-link="false">Wave 7</p>
            <li>At the start of the wave, the Zombie will get up and start walking to the broken House, through the Windmill. Defend the Zombie from other Zombies, till it crawls into the <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_1/debris.webp">debris beside the fireplace</a>.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>It seems Wustlings will still go after the Zombie even if you have Frontline active, so make sure you take care of them.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="sub-sub-step" id="main_ee_step1.7" data-bool-quick-link="false">Wave 8</p>
            <li>The Zombie will emerge from the debris with a battery in one hand. Get kills near the Zombie till the battery is charged and glowing green. Let the Zombies kill the battery Zombie.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If the Zombie dies before the battery is charged, you need to restart the map to try again.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Pick up the battery the Zombie dropped, and place it into the <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_1/generator.webp">generator in the Wine Cellar</a>.</li>
            <li>This will open the door, revealing the <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_1/hilt.webp">Hilt</a> for you to pick up (and the Sword if you've already completed the Main Quest). Picking up the Hilt will give you all Blitz perks for the remainder of the game.</li>
            <li>You're now free to complete the map.</li>

            <li>In the back left corner of the Barracks, there's a battery sitting on a box. Melee it to enter "easter egg vision" mode. While in this mode, electricity will surround your screen, your FOV will increase, and Zombies will occasionally go invisible. All players must go to the battery to enter the mode.</li>

            <li>On the final island, a <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_2/fish_cup_game.webp">fish will appear above the circle</a> on the floor, and multiple cups will be on the floor. The fish will enter one of the cups, and they'll start moving around.</li>
            <li>You must shoot the fish cup, and shoot it once it stops. Shooting the right cup will start the next round of the game with more cups.</li>

            <li>Once you complete three rounds, you'll be teleported back to the ship. The <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_2/pommel.webp">Pommel will be in a crate on the table</a> in front of you (along with the Sword if you've completed the Quest already).

            <li>Once you have your code (or you plan on guessing), go to the Rune Room at the top of the map. Interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/rune_wall.webp">runes on the wall</a> in order. If done correctly, the wall will glow with electricity, and a sound will play.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you enter the code wrong (or the wrong one if you're guessing), repeatedly interact with any rune until they all depress into the wall for a few seconds, then comeback out. This will reset the input.</li>

            <li>Throw a flare into each of the four <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/stone_bowls.webp">stone bowls</a> on the walls below each of the face statues in the Forge Room. You'll need to grab more flares, since you only have two at a time.</li>
            <li>Once all bowls are lit, there will be a <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/final_stone_bowl.webp">fire bowl</a> on the ground, left of where the Supply Crates drop near Laufenblitz (Stamin-Up). Throw a flare into it; a <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/open_wall.webp">wall left of Laufenblitz will open</a>, revealing a rune for you to pick up.</li>
            <li>Place the new Rune on the Rune wall. You must now find (or guess) a new rune code in the same way as before. The old set of runes will still be visible in the same location as before, so make sure you don't reuse these.</li>

            <li>In the Forge Room, a <a href="pictures/main_ee/map_3/rune_3.webp">rune will be in the blood pool</a> for you to pick up (it will fall from one of the face statues that's dropping blood into the pool).</li>
            <li>Place the Rune on the wall and find/enter the new code.</li>

            <li>Interact with the Forge to assemble the Sword. After a couple of seconds, you'll be able to pick up the sword.</li>
            <li>You're now free to complete the map. Upon completion, the cutscene will play, the Sword will be present when you do the Main Quest on any other Tortured Path map, and you'll be able to play on each of the maps in the round-based format.</li>
