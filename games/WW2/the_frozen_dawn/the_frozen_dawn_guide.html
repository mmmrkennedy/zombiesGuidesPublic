                    <li>The God King has two attacks. He can either shoot a bolt of electricity at you or lob bombs that explode after a few seconds.</li>
                    <li>Shoot the God King until he moves to the middle of the arena. He will pull you toward him, "The God King begins to consume blood" will appear on the left side of the screen, and he'll start slowly damaging you.</li>
                    <li>
                        You need to shoot each of the three
                        <a href="pictures/main_ee/god_king_plate.webp">pressure plates around the arena</a>
                        until they stop glowing. One of the pressure plates is in the middle of the arena (below where the God King will be), and the other two are on either side of Thulian Transport near the edges of the map.

                    <li>This will stun the God King, knocking him to the floor, allowing you to do damage. Once the God King gets back up, a Max Ammo, and Full Meter power-up will spawn where he was.</li>

                    <li>During the second phase, he gains another attack where he flies high up into the air, and starts charging a wipe attack. You can hide behind the ice pillars or use the shield's block ability to avoid taking damage.</li>
                    <li>Shoot the God King, and the pressure plates to end the phase just like in phase 1. This is how you complete all future phases as well.</li>

                    <p class="boss-fight-phases">Phase 3</p>
                    <li>The God King will occasionally give some Zombies purple shields, making them invincible. Throw the Hammer at the shields to break them.</li>

                    <p class="boss-fight-phases">Phase 4</p>
                    <li>The God King will fly to the throne and throw out a wall of fire. The player with the Flail needs to teleport to the God King (past the fire) and do damage to stun him and stop the fire. Any player touched by the fire will instantly down.</li>

                    <p class="boss-fight-phases">Phase 5 (Co-op Only)</p>
                    <li>The God King can use all the previous attacks (Wipe, Shields, Fire).</li>

                    <p class="boss-fight-phases">Final Phase</p>
                    <li>After phase 4 (or 5 on Co-op), the God King will go to his throne, pull all players toward him, drop you to 1 HP, and make you kneel. The ending cutscene will play. After the cutscene, you'll be brought back to the arena, with the God King sitting on his throne. Shoot him until he dies; failing to do so will cause him to wipe your team, ending your game.</li>
                    <li>Once he's dead, you'll have completed the Boss Fight. After the Boss fight, you'll constantly regenerate armour for free for the remainder of the current match. You're able to use the Thulian Transport to go between the arena and main map as much as you want.</li>

                        To colour a piece of equipment, stand near the candles and throw a Frag Grenade, Semtex, C4, or Throwing Knife to either the

                    <li>
                        Throw one piece of equipment and wait until it's the colour you need, then pick it up; this will "set" that equipment's colour permanently. Then throw the piece of equipment back, so it's orbiting again (it should be the colour it was when you picked it up). Throw another piece of equipment
                        <strong>in the same direction as the other one</strong>
                        , so they don't collide midair. Pick up the first piece of equipment as soon as you can (equipment in the air will explode after about 20-30 seconds), and wait for the other equipment to be the right colour; pick it up when it is.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now that you have the two colours required, throw them in
                        <strong>opposite directions</strong>
                        , so they collide midair. The colours should combine, and one of the pieces of equipment will turn the new colour, and the other will explode. Pick up the remaining piece of equipment.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once you have the right colour equipment, jump down from the platform with the candles and then throw the equipment at the power-up. The power-up should disappear.</li>
