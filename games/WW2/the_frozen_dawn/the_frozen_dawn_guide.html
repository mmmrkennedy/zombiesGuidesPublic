            <li>In the 'Crash Site,' pick up the <a href="pictures/hammer/battery.webp">battery in the debris</a> left of the M30 Luftwaffe Drilling wallbuy. Bring it to the <a href="pictures/hammer/bowl.webp">bowl right of the Laufenblitz (Stamin-Up)</a> on the 'Overlook.'</li>
            <li>Get about 15-20 kills near the bowl. It'll glow purple and stop taking energy.</li>
            <li>Pick up four Stones. Locations:</li>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="pictures/hammer/stone_cola.webp">Thulian Archives - Right of Schnellblitz (Speed Cola)</a></li>

            </ol>
            <li>Place the stones in the <a href="pictures/hammer/stone_slots.webp">slots across from the Battery bowl</a>. Each stone will stop the "bloodfall" allowing you to see a <a href="pictures/hammer/runes_bloodfalls.webp">rune</a> (stand by the Armour stand to see). Read these runes from left to right; there are only four possible runes, which vaguely look like the letters F, R, S, M.</li>
            <li>Around the Armour stand, there are <a href="pictures/hammer/runes_to_charge.webp">four runes</a>, one for each of the letters. You need to get a kill at each of the runes in the order indicated by the bloodfall runes.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: If the bloodfall runes are F, F, S, R, then get two kills at F, then one at S, and one at R.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>If done correctly, lightning will start striking the ground in front of the bowl, and the <a href="pictures/hammer/hammer_spawned.webp">Hammer will spawn</a>. Run over to it to make it teleport away.</li>
            <li><a href="pictures/hammer/pillars.webp">Four pillars</a> will rise around the 'Overlook.' Each pillar will have four blocks with a lightning bolt on one side. Using <a href="pictures/hammer/pillar_solver.webp">this image</a> or the solver below, shoot the blocks so all the bolts are facing where the Hammer spawned/the bowl. They will light up when all blocks are facing the right way.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>If you get too close, and you aren't prone, the Hammer will teleport away, and you'll have to find it and try again.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>If done correctly, it will turn horizontal, and start moving away from you. Push it to the 'Overlook.' If the pillars are set correctly, they will stop the <a href="pictures/hammer/hammer_pickup.webp">Hammer, and it will become available to pick up</a>.</li>

        <ol>
            <li>In the 'Crash Site' on the wall right of the Thulian Transport, a <a href="pictures/hammer/upgraded_hammer/rune_1.webp">rune will be glowing with purple electricity</a>. Melee it with the Hammer to transfer the electricity to the Hammer.</li>
            <li>Quickly, run to the 'Ice Caves,' and melee the <a href="pictures/hammer/upgraded_hammer/rune_2.webp">rune on the wall</a> with the Hammer to transfer the electricity.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you take too long, the electricity will respawn at the previous rune, and you can try again immediately.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Melee the rune, and run it to the <a href="pictures/hammer/upgraded_hammer/rune_3.webp">rune on the wall in the 'Morgue.'</a></li>
            <li>You'll now need to transfer the electricity to the <a href="pictures/hammer/upgraded_hammer/rune_4.webp">rune above the door to the 'Morgue' in the 'Phylactery.'</a> You need to kill a Zombie in the doorway with the Hammer while it's electrified.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This is very annoying to do on Solo, since once you get to the 'Phylactery,' you only have about a second to kill a Zombie before the Hammer de-electrifies.</li>
                <li>I recommend you wait for higher rounds when Zombies are running, so any chasing you will be close behind when you get to the rune.</li>
                <li><span style="color: red">Bug(?):</span> Once the Rune in the 'Phylactery' is electrified, put away, then put back out the Hammer. When you pull out the Hammer, it might be electrified, allowing you to skip the first part of the next step.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once the electricity is on the 'Phylactery' rune, lure an enemy to below the rune. The enemy will become electrified; kill it with the Hammer to electrify it. Melee the <a href="pictures/hammer/upgraded_hammer/rune_5.webp">rune below the "contraption"</a> in the 'Blood Altar.'</li>
            <li>You'll now need to shoot <a href="pictures/hammer/upgraded_hammer/contraption_blocks.webp">blocks on the "contraption"</a> so that all the lit sides are facing front. Once you face all the blocks, they'll all spin, and you'll complete round 1 of 3. Use <a href="pictures/hammer/upgraded_hammer/contraption_guide.webp">this image</a> for how to solve each round. You can reset the puzzle round by shooting a skull block if present.</li>
            <li>Once you complete all three rounds, go to the 'Overlook' and, <strong>while holding the Hammer</strong>, walk along the <a href="pictures/hammer/upgraded_hammer/invis_path.webp">invisible path in front of the Armour stand out toward the pyramid</a>. Keep walking till you're stopped, and lifted into the air.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Zombies can chase you down the path, and they aren't slowed like you are, so try to do this between rounds or throw a Jack-in-the-box.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>You'll be teleported to the Stormraven Trial, which is basically a tutorial on how to use the upgraded Hammer. Upon completion, you'll be teleported back.</li>

            <li>A Wustling will spawn in the <a href="pictures/shield/large_pool.webp">large blood pool in the 'Blood Altar'</a> with the Thulian Shield on its back. Kill the Wustling and pick up the Thulian Shield it dropped.</li>
            <li>With the Thulian Shield, you can block enemy attacks while aiming with the shield equipped (it doesn't block damage on your back).</li>

            <li>Let a Corpse Eater fully charge by letting it eat about 2-3 Zombies (it’ll glow red once it’s eaten enough Zombies).</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A fully charged Corpse Eater will spawn every time you shoot a Raven statue in the <a href="#raven_claw">Raven's Claw Special Pistol</a> quest. You can use these to not have to pass rounds.</li>
                <li>Two uncharged Corpse Eaters will spawn when you come back from Pack-a-Punch. They need to eat three Zombies to be charged.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Kill the Corpse Eater while it's standing in the Pool. If done right, the blood pool will show <a href="pictures/shield/upgraded_shield/pattern.webp">a pattern</a> (different every game).</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You don't have to be holding the shield to kill the Corpse Eater in the pool. It will still work, but you won't be able to see the mist or the pattern.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Repeat for the two remaining pools. Remember the order you "activated" the pools in.</li>
            <li>Blow up a Bomber (first spawn is on wave 8) on the <a href="pictures/shield/upgraded_shield/metal_door.webp">metal door</a> in the 'Crash Site' to reveal a radio and speaker.</li>
            <li>Place both items at the Blood Pool in the 'Blood Altar' (<a href="pictures/shield/upgraded_shield/radio.webp">Radio location</a> and <a href="pictures/shield/upgraded_shield/speaker.webp">speaker location</a>). Interact with the radio to make patterns appear similar to those in the smaller Blood Pools.</li>
            <li>Cycle through patterns by interacting with the radio; <a href="pictures/shield/upgraded_shield/frozen_dawn_blood_patterns.webp">image of all the patterns</a>. When one matches the pattern from the first Blood Pool, get a kill in the Blood Altar pool. Repeat for the other two patterns in order.</li>
            <li>If done correctly, the Blood Pool will flash symbols rapidly. While holding the Shield, go down in the blood.</li>
            <li>You'll be teleported to the Bloodraven Trial, which is basically a tutorial on how to use the upgraded Shield. Upon completion, you'll be teleported back.</li>

        <p class="stats">Stats (Solo): Difficulty - 8/10, Est. Completion Time - 1:20 Hr to 1:35 Hr</p>
        <ol>
            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step1">Upgraded Raven Lord Wonder Weapons</p>
            <li>Obtain all four upgraded Raven Lord Wonder Weapons: <a href="#scythe">Thulian Scythe</a>, <a href="#hammer">Thulian Hammer</a>, <a href="#shield">Thulian Shield</a>, and <a href="#flail">Broken Flail</a>.</li>
            <li>Place the weapons in the <a href="pictures/main_ee/weapon_pedestals.webp">pedestals on the edge of the cliff</a> in the 'Ice Caves.' You can place Scythe, Hammer, and Flail in any of the pedestals, but the Shield goes on the <a href="pictures/main_ee/shield_circle.webp">stone circle on the floor in front of the pedestals</a>.</li>

            <p class="warning">Warning: Point of No Return. Once you activate the Transport, you'll be put into the Boss Fight.</p>

            <li>All players must enter the newly activated <a href="pictures/main_ee/boss_fight_transport.webp">Thulian Transport in the 'Ice Caves,'</a> left of the door to the 'Morgue.' After a short cutscene, you'll be taken to the God King Boss Fight arena. Any Raven weapons not brought by a player will spawn on the floor in front of the Thulian Transport for you to freely swap between.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step2">God King Boss Fight</p>
            <p class="boss-fight-phases">Phase 1</p>
            <li>The God King has two attacks. He can either shoot a bolt of electricity at you or lob bombs that explode after a few seconds.</li>
            <li>Shoot the God King until he moves to the middle of the arena. He will pull you toward him, "The God King begins to consume blood" will appear on the left side of the screen, and he'll start slowly damaging you.</li>
            <li>You need to shoot each of the three <a href="pictures/main_ee/god_king_plate.webp">pressure plates around the arena</a> until they stop glowing. One of the pressure plates is in the middle of the arena (below where the God King will be), and the other two are on either side of Thulian Transport near the edges of the map.</li>
            <li>This will stun the God King, knocking him to the floor, allowing you to do damage (you don't need to though). Once the God King gets back up, a Max Ammo, and Full Meter power up will spawn where he was.</li>

            <p class="boss-fight-phases">Phase 2</p>
            <li>During the second phase (and only the second phase), he gains another attack where he flies high up into the air, and start charging a wipe attack. You can hide behind the ice pillars or use the shield's block ability to avoid taking damage.</li>
            <li>Shoot the God King, and the pressure plates to end the phase just like in phase 1. This is how you complete all future phases as well.</li>

            <p class="boss-fight-phases">Phase 3</p>
            <li>The God King will occasionally give some Zombies purple shields, making them invincible. Throw the Hammer at the shields to break them.</li>

            <p class="boss-fight-phases">Phase 4</p>
            <li>The God King will fly to the throne and throw out a wall of fire. The player with the Flail needs to teleport to the God King (past the fire) and do damage to stun him and stop the fire. Any player touched by the fire will instantly down.</li>

            <p class="boss-fight-phases">Phase 5 (Co-op Only)</p>
            <li>The God King can use all the previous attacks (Wipe, Shields, Fire).</li>

            <p class="boss-fight-phases">Final Phase</p>
            <li>After phase 4 (or 5 on Co-op), the God King will go to his throne, pull all players toward him, drop you to 1 HP, and make you kneel. The ending cutscene will play. After the cutscene, you'll be brought back to the arena, with the God King sitting on his throne. Shoot him until he dies; failing to do so will cause him to wipe your team.</li>
            <li>Once he's dead, you'll have completed the Boss Fight. After the Boss fight, you'll constantly regenerate armour for free for the remainder of the current match. You're able to use the Thulian Transport to go between the arena and main map as much as you want.</li>
