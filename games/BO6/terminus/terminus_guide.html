                    <li>
                        Obtain a weapon with the Dead Wire ammo mod. Activate the Pack-a-Punch elevator and ride it either up or down; while riding, look across from the Pack-a-Punch to see a

                    <li>
                        Once shot, the fuse box and wire connected to it should electrify. Follow the wire to the next

                        (below the elevator door, on the left side of the Pack-a-Punch machine) and shoot it with Dead Wire.

                        There are three more fuse boxes that need to be shot in the following order:

                        will open to the 'Research Office.' Kill the

                        You'll now need to get a code. You can either pay Peck 5000 points in the 'Guard Station' for the code (interact with the computer first), or you can find the code yourself (recommended). To find the code, you'll need to find three computers. Each computer will display a symbol when activated, and have a corresponding letter (X, Y, or Z) on the
                        <a href="pictures/beamsmasher/symbol_and_letter.webp">table beside it</a>

                        Once all three computers are activated, return to the 'Research Office,' and interact with the computer you placed the Multiphasic Resonator on. You should see

                        . Interact with it to place the Multiphasic Resonator below it. The orb will randomly electrify Zombies; killing an electric zombie will drop a small energy orb. Pick up the small orb and carry it into the main large orb.

                        After bringing two small orbs to the large orb, it will fly away, and you'll be able to pick the Multiphasic Resonator back up. Follow the orb as it travels to 'Crab Island' (

                        Repeat the same process on 'Crab Island' (place Multiphasic Resonator, fill large orb with two small orbs, pick up Multiphasic Resonator). The orb will then fly to 'Temple Island' (

                    <li>Take the Hard Drive to the Guard Station where Peck and Strauss are located and insert it into the slot under the window. You can then go down to the middle of the Bio Lab to reveal Nathan's chamber by interacting with the main window/keypad on it.</li>
                    <li>
                        You need to find a 3-digit code around the map. Once you find the code, you can use the keypad at Nathan's chamber to input it.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Code 1 is found by going to the Interrogation Room and looking at the clock behind the barrier. The main hour hand of the clock is the first digit.</li>
                            <li>Code 2 is found by going to the Mess Hall/Kitchen area. There is a playing card on a corkboard. The number is whatever is on the playing card.</li>
                            <li>Code 3 is found by going to the Engineering room. In there a sign dictating how many days since incident is on the wall. The number on that sign is the digit you need.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Once you input the code, the chamber is ready to open. All players in the game need to interact with the valves on the chamber and the bossfight with Nathan will begin. Nathan is an Amalgam and has the same weaknesses as other Amalgam (Dead Wire and Shadow Rift). Once he is defeated you will watch a cutscene.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>Jumping into the water next to Nathan's corpse, you can find a keycard. Next, head to the Communications room and interact with a computer that has a black screen and green text. Peck will tell you that the communications line has been cut, and that they require reconnecting with Node Connectors.</li>
                    <li>
                        Go to the Shipwreck. Underneath the Shipwreck there is a ladder you can go up to find a room containing the Node Connectors. The room only opens once you have the aforementioned Keycard. Once you pick up a Node Connector you will have to complete a lockdown in that room. Once the lockdown is over, a Max Ammo will spawn. After this, take the Node Connectors to two of the following areas, where there will be a visible gap to install the connectors.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Right side of Sea Cave</li>
                            <li>Underneath the Sea Tower at the Docks</li>
                            <li>Leftmost side of Crab Island</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Once both connectors are placed, head back to the Guard Station and grab the hacking device.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>In the water, there are 3 buoys you need to hack by going up to them by boat and interacting with them while having the hacking device in your inventory. You can use your map and see where a lot of red dots (Parasites) are and use that as a guide for where the buoys are. The hacking is on a timer so you must do all 3 in succession or else you will need to start over. The 3 buoys are located near the Docks, the Shipwreck, and Temple Island, and can be hacked in any order.</li>
                    <li>3 bombs behind revealed doors will need to be defused in the Bio Lab immediately after hacking the 3 satellites. You have 5 minutes to defuse the bombs or else the entire island will explode, killing you. During this step an infinite amount of zombies will spawn. Manglers can spawn after defusing the first bomb, while Amalgams will spawn after defusing the second bomb.</li>
                    <li>Once all the bombs are defused you can now interact with a door next to Melee Macchiato to initiate the Final Encounter.</li>

                        <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step5">Patient 13 Boss Fight</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>The bossfight will begin with Patient 13 having weak spots on its shoulders. They are glowing red and damaging them will deal increased damage to Patient 13 (extra damage can be dealt to these spots using Napalm Burst ammo mod). These glowing spots will change position sporadically throughout the phase.</li>
                    <li>When Patient 13 has taken enough damage, it will leave the area for a short while. You are required to survive the hordes of zombies and various tentacles shooting projectiles at you. Notably, some of the projectile attacks may leave behind a green acidic puddle on the ground, which will damage you if you stand in there. After surviving long enough, Patient 13 will return to the arena. A Max Ammo will spawn at this point allowing players to replenish.</li>
                    <li>When Patient 13 comes back, it can be in one of two states. In one state, its arms will have weak points similar to the tentacles (extra damage can be dealt here using Dead Wire ammo mod). Once those have been damaged enough it will change to the other state, where its mouth will be a weak point (also weak to Cryofreeze ammo mod). The rest of Patient 13's body will be coated in armor, greatly reducing the amount of damage it will take when being damaged on areas besides its weak point. Once damaged enough, Patient 13 will leave once more, and you have to survive for some time before it returns for the third phase. Another Max Ammo will spawn to signal the beginning of the new phase.</li>
                    <li>In the third phase, Patient 13 will gain a few more attacks. Notably, it will have an attack where it will start to summon a mass of blue energy above its head and you will have a faint blue aura around your screen. Be sure to hide behind crates in the boss arena or jump in the water to break the boss's line-of-sight from you. If you are hit by the attack you will instantly be put into Last Stand.</li>
                    <li>Another attack Patient 13 can do is extend its tongue. It will extend its tongue and any player hit by it will begin to be dragged into the boss's mouth. If you are grabbed, aim to hit weak points on the boss (the red shoulders from the initial phase) as it is the only way to be broken free. If dragged into the mouth, you will be instantly spit out and put into Last Stand.</li>
                    <li>When it has take enough damage, its eyes will become a glowing blue weak spot (which can be dealt extra damage with Shadow Rift ammo mod). Once the eyes have been destroyed the boss will cycle between which weak points are available to damage until it is killed.</li>

                <p>Cooking a fish and collecting it without using any additional ingredients will allow you to give the fish to Peck if you paid him points to obtain the code for the Beamsmasher. Doing so will provide you with the points you bribed him with.</p>
