        <h2>Jet Gun (Thrustodyne M23)</h2>
        <p class="weapon-desc">The Jet Gun is available from the mystery box, through the completion of S.A.M. trials, and via the following quest:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Walk up to <a href="pictures/jet_gun/motel_door.webp">this door</a> on the upper level of the Motel. It will fly open and Zombies will spill out. Inside is the <a href="pictures/jet_gun/jet_gun_workbench.webp">workbench</a> used to build the Jet Gun.</li>
            <li>The Jet Gun requires three parts to be built - Gauge, Handbrake, and Wires:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Gauge
                    <ol>
                        <li>Pick up the <a href="pictures/jet_gun/water_valve.webp">Water Valve</a> from the water pipe, right of Speed Cola on Washington Ave.</li>
                        <li>Go to the Bowling Alley and shoot <a href="pictures/jet_gun/panel.webp">this panel</a> to knock it off the wall. Interact with the gauge to place the valve.</li>
                        <li>You must now hold interact on the valve to "build pressure". While turning the valve, Zombies will start spawning.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You can stop interacting with the valve if needed, but you can’t leave the Bowling Alley for too long. if you leave, your progress will reset, but you can retry immediately.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Once enough pressure is built, the Zombies will die and the <a href="pictures/jet_gun/gauge.webp">gauge</a> will fall to the floor for you to pick up.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Handbrake
                    <ol>
                        <li>Wait in the Cemetery until a Zombie spawns called the "<a href="pictures/jet_gun/groundskeeper.webp">Groundskeeper</a>." Kill it and pick up the <a href="pictures/jet_gun/toolshed_key.webp">Toolshed Key</a> he drops.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This Zombie is not aggressive and will not attack you. He will spawn in, wander around the Cemetery, and teleport away.</li>
                            <li>There is no known way to spawn the Groundskeeper (if you even can spawn him manually), so just spend a couple of rounds in the Cemetery, and he should spawn.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Once you have the key, interact with the <a href="pictures/jet_gun/toolshed.webp">door of the shed</a> in the Groundskeeper’s Yard. The door will open, allowing you to pick up the <a href="pictures/jet_gun/handbrake.webp">Handbrake on the table inside</a>.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Wires
                    <ol>
                        <li>Obtain a Mangler Cannon or Mutant Injection scorestreak.</li>
                        <li>In the Riverside area, shoot the <a href="pictures/jet_gun/metal_gate.webp">metal gate</a> blocking the entrance to the <a href="pictures/jet_gun/radio_house.webp">Radio House store</a> with a Mangler Cannon (either by you or an enemy Mangler). This will cause the gate to break open.</li>
                        <li>On the floor inside the store, there are four <a href="pictures/jet_gun/garbage_pile.webp">garbage piles</a>. Interact with each of the piles until the <a href="pictures/jet_gun/electrical_wires.webp">Electrical Wires</a> spawn. Pick up the wires.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once you have all three parts, the Jet Gun can be built on the workbench in the Motel.</li>

            <li>Go to 'Hill Street' and drop the canister on one of the <a href="pictures/main_ee/dagf_node_1.webp">Dark Aether Field Generator nodes</a> (the thing that produces the field).</li>
            <li>Go to the 'Cemetery' and place the L.T.G. on the <a href="pictures/main_ee/storm_cemetery.webp">metal under the Aether cloud storm</a>. This will start a timed event where you must defend the L.T.G. from Zombies.</li>

                <li>If you fail to defend the L.T.G., you will have to wait until the next round to retry.</li>

            <li>Once the HVT is glowing purple, bring it to the trap where you dropped the canister and activate it. Kill the HVT while it is standing in the trap. If done correctly, the canister will suck up the "essence" of the HVT. The HVT and canister have to be in the same trap "node".</li>
