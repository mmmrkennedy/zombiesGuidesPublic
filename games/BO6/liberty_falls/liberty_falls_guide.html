        <h2>Jet Gun (Thrustodyne M23)</h2>
        <p class="weapon-desc">The Jet Gun is available from the mystery box, through the completion of S.A.M. trials, and via the following quest:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Walk up to <a href="pictures/jet_gun/motel_door.webp">this door</a> on the upper level of the Motel. It will fly open and Zombies will spill out. Inside is the <a href="pictures/jet_gun/jet_gun_workbench.webp">workbench</a> used to build the Jet Gun.</li>
            <li>The Jet Gun requires three parts to be built - Gauge, Handbrake, and Wires:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Gauge
                    <ol>
                        <li>Pick up the <a href="pictures/jet_gun/water_valve.webp">Water Valve</a> from the water pipe, right of Speed Cola on 'Washington Ave.'</li>
                        <li>Go to the Bowling Alley and shoot <a href="pictures/jet_gun/panel.webp">this panel</a> to knock it off the wall. Interact with the gauge to place the valve.</li>
                        <li>You must now hold interact on the valve to "build pressure". When you interact with the valve for the first time, Zombies will start spawning.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You can stop interacting with the valve if needed, but you can’t leave the Bowling Alley for too long. If you leave, your progress will reset, but you can retry immediately.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Once enough pressure is built, the Zombies will die and the <a href="pictures/jet_gun/gauge.webp">gauge</a> will fall to the floor for you to pick up.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Handbrake
                    <ol>
                        <li>Wait in the Cemetery until a Zombie spawns called the "<a href="pictures/jet_gun/groundskeeper.webp">Groundskeeper</a>." Kill him and pick up the <a href="pictures/jet_gun/toolshed_key.webp">Toolshed Key</a> he drops.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This Zombie is not aggressive and will not attack you. He will spawn in, wander around the Cemetery, and teleport away.</li>
                            <li>There is no known way to spawn the Groundskeeper (if you even can spawn him manually), so just spend a couple of rounds in the Cemetery, and he should spawn.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Once you have the key, interact with the <a href="pictures/jet_gun/toolshed.webp">door of the shed</a> in the Groundskeeper’s Yard. The door will open, allowing you to pick up the <a href="pictures/jet_gun/handbrake.webp">Handbrake on the table inside</a>.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Wires
                    <ol>
                        <li>Obtain a Mangler Cannon or Mutant Injection scorestreak. You can consistently get a Cannon to drop from a Mangler if you shoot the shoulder of the arm with the cannon.</li>
                        <li>In the Riverside area, shoot the <a href="pictures/jet_gun/metal_gate.webp">metal gate</a> blocking the entrance to the <a href="pictures/jet_gun/radio_house.webp">Radio House store</a> with a Mangler Cannon (either by you or an enemy Mangler) to break it open.</li>
                        <li>On the floor inside the store, there are four <a href="pictures/jet_gun/garbage_pile.webp">garbage piles</a>. Interact with each of the piles until you get the <a href="pictures/jet_gun/electrical_wires.webp">Electrical Wires</a>. Pick up the wires.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once you have all three parts, the Jet Gun can be built on the workbench in the Motel.</li>

            <li> Interact with this <a href="pictures/main_ee/sdg.webp">machine in the Church</a> (called the SDG). All Zombies will die and an in-game story cutscene will start. You don't have to stay in the Church for the cutscene.</li>
            <li>Obtain the <a href="#jet_gun">Jet Gun</a>.</li>
            <li>There are three parts to the L.T.G. around the map that you must suck up using the Jet Gun’s primary fire (the suck). Part locations: </li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/ltg_church.webp">Dark Aether (Church) - Floating on the left side of the upper level in the Church</a></li>

            <li>Once you have all three parts, the L.T.G. can be crafted at the <a href="pictures/main_ee/ltg_workbench.webp">workbench</a> on "The Alamo" (the roof of the Bank).</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step2">Canister #1</p>
            <li>Interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/sdg.webp">machine in the Church</a> to pick up an Aether Canister.</li>
            <li>Go to 'Hill Street' and drop the canister on one of the <a href="pictures/main_ee/dagf_node_1.webp">Dark Aether Field Generator nodes</a>.</li>
            <li>Go to the 'Cemetery' and place the L.T.G. on the <a href="pictures/main_ee/storm_cemetery.webp">metal under the Aether cloud storm</a>. This will start a timed event where you must defend the L.T.G. from Zombies.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you fail to defend the L.T.G., you will have to wait until the next round to retry.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once you've defended the L.T.G., it will turn red and spawn an HVT. Shoot the HVT until it <a href="pictures/main_ee/purple_hvt.webp">glows purple</a> (happens at about 10% health remaining).</li>
            <li>Once the HVT is glowing purple, lure it into the same trap node where you dropped the canister. Activate the trap while the HVT is standing inside it, and then kill the HVT (with anything) within the trap. If done correctly, the canister will absorb the HVT’s "essence."</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you kill the HVT early, end the round and interact with the L.T.G. to respawn the HVT.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Pick up the canister and bring it back to the SDG before the countdown expires.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you don’t bring it back in time, wait one round then interact with the L.T.G. to spawn another HVT.</li>

            <li>There are three Aether Projectors around the map that need to be set to the correct colour using the Strauss Counter (see below). When near a projector, pull out the counter and look at the colour it is displaying.

            <p class="warning">Warning: Point of No Return. Once you interact with the SDG after delivering the canister, you will be put into the Boss Fight.</p>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step5">Boss Fight</p>
            <li>All players will be teleported to the 'Dark Aether' (Church). The Boss Fight consists of three round where you must either kill all enemies or kill a boss enemy to end the wave.</li>
            <li>On round 1, kill all the Zombies until they stop spawning, and a Full Armour power-up spawns.</li>
            <li>For rounds 2 and 3, a HVT (one per wave on Solo, more per wave on Co-op) will spawn. Zombies will start infinitely spawning and will only stop once you kill the HVT(s). After wave 2, a Max Ammo will spawn.</li>
            <li>Once the third and final wave is complete, all players will be downed and the final cutscene will begin. After the cutscene ends, you can choose to keep playing. If you do, you'll be given all perks, as well as a bunch of loot, like level 3 PAP crystals, and Orange Aether Tools.</li>

            <li>Rewards will be awarded based on how well you do, more points will give you better rewards. If any player gets at least 300 points, all players will be awarded the Dark Ops Calling Card "Strike!".</li>

            <li>You can now use the <a href="pictures/opening_bank_vault/loot_key.webp">Loot Keys</a> dropped by killing enemies to open the safety deposit boxes inside the vault. The better the rarity of the key (same colours as the weapons), the better the loot.</li>
