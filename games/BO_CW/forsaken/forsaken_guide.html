            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step6">Forsaken Boss Fight</p>
            <li>To simplify the explanation of this boss fight, I'm going to split this into two parts: How to Attack
                the Forsaken and How The Forsaken Attacks.
            </li>
            <li>How to Attack:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>The Forsaken has four armoured spots that need to be broken to be able to damage him. These spots
                    can only be broken in the following order: <br>Either of the two shoulders, the other Shoulder, the
                    Lower Torso and the Top of the Head.
                </li>
                <li>Once one of these spots has been broken, a weak spot will be revealed. You need to shoot these weak
                    spots with either of the two laser cannons.
                </li>
                <li>To charge the cannons, you must charge Sam by killing zombies in the circle below her.</li>
                <li>Once she is charged, she will activate one of the cannons allowing you to shoot the Forsaken.</li>
                <li><i>Repeat Steps 1-4 for each of the four armoured/weak spots.</i></li>
            </ol>
            <li> How The Forsaken Attacks:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The Forsaken has four attacks: Lightning Slam, Blizzard, Energy Ball and Laser Eyes</li>
                <li>Lightning Slam: While he still has arms, The Forsaken can raise one of his arms and slam it on the
                    ground which will produce electric shockwaves. Any players caught under the hand will be instantly
                    downed. The shockwave ripples out from the Hand, doing less damage the further from the hand they
                    get.
                </li>
                <li>Blizzard: If you destroy the right arm first, the Forsaken will start attacking with the Blizzard
                    attack. The Forsaken will raise his damaged arm and spawn two areas of frost that slow players
                    within it.
                </li>
                <li>Energy Ball: If you destroy the left arm first, the Forsaken will start attacking with the Energy
                    Ball attack. The Forsaken will raise his damaged arm and produce tracking energy orbs that will do
                    damage to any player in its radius.
                </li>
                <li>Once both arms are destroyed, the Forsaken will no longer use his Lightning Slam attack, however, he
                    will still use the Energy Ball and Blizzard Attacks.
                </li>
                <li>Once both arms are destroyed, the Forsaken will shoot a laser out of his eyes that tracks one
                    player, doing damage if they're in the area.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once the last weak spot has been shot, the health bar hits 0 and disappears, a narrative sequence will
                begin and the Forsaken will slowly damage all players till they go down. The players can down themselves
                (via explosives or letting the Zombies down them) before being killed by the Forsaken to skip some voice
                lines.
            </li>
            <li>Once all players are downed and the voice lines are finished, a cutscene will start. After it is
                finished, an in-game cutscene will start followed by the final cutscene.
            </li>
