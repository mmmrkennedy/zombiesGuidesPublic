        <h2>D.I.E. Shockwave</h2>
        <p class="weapon-desc">The D.I.E. Shockwave is a weapon that fires an energy blast, capable of killing multiple Zombies with one shot. It can be Pack-a-Punched, and there are four variants, the <a href="#nova_5">Nova-5</a>, <a href="#cryo_emitter">Cryo Emitter</a>, <a href="#elecrobolt">Electrobolt</a> or <a href="#thermophasic">Thermophasic</a>.</p>
        <p class="weapon-desc">The D.I.E. Shockwave is available from the mystery box, through the completion of trials, and via the following quest: </p>

            <li>In the "Living Room," interact with this <a href="pictures/die/shockwave/brokenwall.webp">Broken Wall</a> to activate the "D.I.E.". The D.I.E. needs to be charged by sucking zombies through the window of the door. If the D.I.E. turns off without sucking up enough zombies, it will go on cooldown for about 30 seconds, after which you can activate it again.</li>
            <li>Once enough zombies are sucked up, interact with the wall again, and the D.I.E. will shoot the door off.</li>
            <li>Once the door has been blown off, the <a href="pictures/die/shockwave/pickup.webp">D.I.E. Shockwave</a> should be available for pickup.</li>

            <li>Kill a Plaguehound near the canister to make the Cleaning Unit suck up the gas from the Plaguehound.</li>
            <li>Once all the gas has been collected, pick up the canister and place it on the <a href="pictures/die/nova_5/nova_crate.webp">Weapon Crate</a> in the 'Crash Site.' </li>
            <li>Melee the canister to destroy the vines on the crate. The Nova-5 upgrade can now be picked up from the Weapon Crate.</li>

The box will fall to the ground below, breaking on impact, allowing you to pick up the <a href="pictures/die/cryo_emitter/flaskbox_broken.webp">Flask</a>.</li>
            <li>Have a Megaton shoot the <a href="pictures/die/cryo_emitter/fungus.webp">fungus on a tree in the 'Pond'</a> with its long-range attack. If the Fungus is hit by the Megaton, it will <a href="pictures/die/cryo_emitter/activated_fungus.webp">turn purple</a>.</li>
            <li>Place the Flask below the Fungus on the ground. Wait 60 Seconds for the flask to fill.</li>
            <li>Once filled, pick up the flask and interact with the <a href="pictures/die/cryo_emitter/cryo_crate.webp">Weapon Crate</a> in the 'Medical Bay' to break the chains on it.</li>

            <p class="warning">Warning: Other variants of the D.I.E. might struggle to accurately do the following step, so it is recommended to return the D.I.E. to the Shockwave/default variant.</p>
            <li>While the D.I.E. has the energy, shoot the <a href="pictures/die/electrobolt/elec_crate.webp">Weapon Crate</a> in the 'Particle Accelerator' with the D.I.E. If done correctly, one of the crystals on the crate will begin glowing.</li>
            <li>Once all three crystal's energy has been transferred to the crate, you can pick up the upgrade from the Weapon Crate.</li>
