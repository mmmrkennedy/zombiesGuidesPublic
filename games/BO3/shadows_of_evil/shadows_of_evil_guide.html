This will turn the Perk Machine on for the remainder of the game.</li>
            <li>In addition to the Perk Machine fuse boxes, there are five fuse boxes, about one per district, that open doors/stairs that can't otherwise be purchased.</li>

            <li>Before you can start any of the rituals, you'll need the Summoning Key.

                    <li>Once inside Nero's room, follow the path until you reach a <a href="pictures/pap/nero_spawn/nero_fuse_box.webp">fuse box outside</a>. Electrocute the fuse box to open the staircase from the Spawn up to Nero's room. You can now exit Beast Mode.</li>
                    <li>Once the fuse box is shocked, the Crane will move, dropping a <a href="pictures/pap/nero_spawn/lawyers_pen.webp">box with the Lawyer's Pen inside</a>. Pick up the Pen; Two keepers will spawn.</li>

        <h2 class="section-title">Beast Mode</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Beast Mode is a special timed mode you can enter (similar to Afterlife in BO2's Mob of the Dead) that allows you to do actions (open doors, power perks, etc.) that you can't do otherwise.</li>
            <li>You can enter Beast Mode by interacting with any <a href="pictures/beast_mode/beast_mode_chalice.webp">flaming chalice around the map</a>. Once a chalice is used (by any player), it will remain inactive for the remainder of the round, indicated by a <a href="pictures/beast_mode/red_chalice.webp">dull, red glow</a>.</li>
            <li>You can enter Beast Mode once per round (or three per round on Solo). If the Beast icon, on the bottom-left of the HUD, is lit up <a href="pictures/beast_mode/beast_mode_icon_blue.webp">blue</a>, then you can enter Beast Mode. The icon will be <a href="pictures/beast_mode/red_beast_icon.webp">red</a> if you have no Beast Mode "charges" left. You will get a Beast Mode charge back at the start of each round (only one per round on solo also).</li>
            <li>Beast Mode lasts 25 seconds, but meleeing (whether you hit something or not) will drain 3% of you Beast "time." Once it's over, you'll be brought back to the Chalice you entered. Unlike Afterlife, letting the timer run out will not down you in, but just return you to normal.</li>
            <li>While in Beast Mode, enemies will ignore you, and you run a lot faster. You can power fuse boxes with the shock attack, destroy special doors and crates by meleeing them, grapple up to otherwise inaccessible places, shock and melee Zombies, and revive teammates. Reviving a teammate in Beast Mode will instantly return you to normal.</li>

The colour indicates the quality of the reward you can get. Pods will regrow to Green a couple of rounds after being opened.</li>
            <li>To open a Pod, you'll need to find a Fumigator. Each player will need their own Fumigator to open pods. Once you have a Fumigator, interact with a Pod to open it. Only one Fumigator will spawn per district. Fumigator locations:</li>

            <li>The Sword's primary attack stays the same, but the secondary attack is changed to a downward slice that spawns a floating sword that attacks nearby enemies. Doing the secondary attack while the floating sword is out will recall it back to you. The Sword can be put away while the floating sword is active, and it will continue to attack enemies until you run out of Special Weapon charge.</li>

When you place the flag at a defence location, the Meatballs will start going after the flag. Kill them before they reach the flag—if it takes too much damage, it breaks and you'll have to end the round to retry. While you're defending the flag, the Shadowman will occasionally spawn in the air around the flag; shoot him to make him disappear. Failing to shoot him in time will cause him to spawn a lot of parasites. Defence locations:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Junction</li>

            <li>After 30 seconds, the flag will make a sound and start <a href="pictures/main_ee/">pulsing red</a>; you can now pick it up and bring it to the next location.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A Max Ammo will spawn above the flag when you pick it up, so make sure to grab it.</li>
                <li>Successfully defending a location will make it permanently completed, meaning if you fail the next defence and the flag is destroyed, you don't need to repeat the completed defence again.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once you've given the Flag to one district's Keeper, you'll need to end the current round to respawn the flag to do another district.</li>
            <li>Once all four Keepers have been given flags, they will spawn beside the Gateworm pedestals in the Pack-a-Punch room. Each player must interact with a Keeper to give it their upgraded Sword.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step3">Shadowman Boss Fight</p>
            <li>Once the last keeper is given a Sword, the Boss Fight will start.</li>
            <li>The Shadowman will appear in the middle of the room with a shield around him. The Keepers will fire a beam at him, breaking the shield and stunning the Shadowman.</li>
            <li>While the Shadowman is stunned, quickly shoot him to make him teleport around the arena. Keep shooting him until he's above the <a href="pictures/main_ee/">Ritual Table near the entrance to the room.</a></li>
            <li>Once he's over the table, interact with it to capture the Shadowman in the Summoning Key.</li>
            <li>If you take too long to get the Shadowman to the Ritual Table, he'll recover from the stun and teleport back to the middle of the room with the shield. Also, he'll spawn a Margwa.</li>
            <li>You must interact with each Keeper to activate them, indicated by the CHANGE ME. Once activated, they'll break the Shadowman's shield, and you can try shooting him again.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The Shadowman has an attack that can deactivate an activated Keeper, so you have to interact with them again to activate them. This attack is indicated by CHANGE ME and can be avoided by CHANGE ME.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once you've captured the Shadowman in the Summoning Key, the boss fight will end. If you don't have four players in the game, the Main Quest will end here.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step4">Destroy the Giant Gateworm (4-Player Only)</p>
            <li>If you do have four players, a giant Gateworm will appear on top of the ritual table, where you captured the Shadowman, for a couple of seconds. After a couple of seconds, all players will be "corrupted" (indicated by the red mist on screen). You must find a white orb around the map and walk into it to temporarily clean the corruption (a white orb will always spawn on the ritual table), otherwise, failing to do so in time will down you. This corruption will comeback </li>
            <li>Zombies will no longer spawn, instead, purple-mouth Margwas will spawn. Killing one of these Margwas will activate a couple of Beast Mode chalices around the map.</li>
            <li>During this part of the Main Quest, Beast Mode will be infinite, but Margwas can still see and attack you. Taking damage in Beast Mode will take chunks off your Beast Mode meter; if it hits zero, you'll be removed from Beast Mode.</li>
            <li>In the middle of the Junction, the giant Gateworm and three Keepers will spawn where all the train track meet. Your goal is to destroy the giant Gateworm in the middle of the Junction, then shock the three Keepers so they fire a beam at the large creature in the sky. To do this, you'll need to hit the Gateworm with the train; this will make it disappear for 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>To explain this easier, I will divide this part into what each player needs to do.</li>
