        <h2 class="section-title">Beast Mode</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Beast Mode is a special timed mode you can enter (similar to Afterlife in BO2's Mob of the Dead) that allows you to do actions (open doors, power perks, etc.) that you can't do otherwise.</li>
            <li>You can enter Beast Mode by interacting with any <a href="pictures/beast_mode/beast_mode_chalice.png">flaming chalice around the map</a>. Once a chalice is used (by any player), it will remain inactive for the remainder of the round, indicated by a <a href="pictures/beast_mode/red_chalice.png">dull, red glow</a>.</li>
            <li>You can enter Beast Mode once per round (or three per round on Solo). If the Beast icon, on the bottom-left of the HUD, is lit up <a href="pictures/beast_mode/beast_mode_icon_blue.png">blue</a>, then you can enter Beast Mode. The icon will be <a href="pictures/beast_mode/red_beast_icon.png">red</a> if you have no Beast Mode "charges" left. You will get a Beast Mode charge back at the start of each round (only one per round on solo also).</li>
            <li>Beast Mode lasts 25 seconds, but meleeing (whether you hit something or not) will drain 3% of you Beast "time." Once it's over, you'll be brought back to the Chalice you entered. Unlike Afterlife, letting the timer run out will not down you in, but just return you to normal.</li>
            <li>While in Beast Mode, enemies will ignore you, and you run a lot faster. You can power fuse boxes with the shock attack, destroy special doors and crates by meleeing them, grapple up to otherwise inaccessible places, shock and melee Zombies, and revive teammates. Reviving a teammate in Beast Mode will instantly return you to normal.</li>

Every couple of rounds (if not opened), the Pods will grow larger and change colour, from <a href="pictures/fumigator_pods/green_pod.png">Green</a> to <a href="pictures/fumigator_pods/red_pod.png">Red</a>, then to <a href="pictures/fumigator_pods/purple_pod.png">Purple</a>. The colour indicates the quality of the reward you can get. Pods will regrow to Green a couple of rounds after being opened.</li>
            <li>To open a Pod, you'll need to find a Fumigator. Each player will need their own Fumigator to open pods. Once you have a Fumigator, interact with a Pod to open it. Only one Fumigator will spawn per district. Fumigator locations:</li>

The descriptions below are all from the perspective of coming from that district station. All the symbols are about eye-level, so you won't have to look up or down to see them. Symbol locations:</li>

            <li>Pick up an egg from the structure. Each player has their own egg and must complete the following steps independently to get a Sword.</li>
            <li>In each of the Districts (and the Underground), there will be a <a href="pictures/apothicon_sword/wooden_box_underground.png">tall, wooden box</a> that can be broken open with a melee while in Beast Mode. Inside the boxes, there'll be an <a href="pictures/apothicon_sword/apothicon_statue.png">Apothicon Statue</a>. Place the Egg on a statue (in any order) and kill about 12 Zombies near it to charge the Egg. Once charged, the Egg will make a sound and stop collecting Souls. Pick up the Egg and charge it at any of the other statues. Statue/Box locations:</li>

            <li>Once you have your new egg, place it on any of the symbols drawn on the ground in the Districts. This will spawn one Margwa (or two on a ritual that's not the first); the Margwa will only go after the player who spawned it. Kill the Margwa(s) to charge the Egg.</li>
            <ul>

            <li>Once you've completed all four Rituals successfully, return to the Ghost Keeper and interact with it to give it your Sword. After a couple of seconds, you can pick up the Upgraded Sword.</li>
            <li>The Sword's primary attack stays the same, but the secondary attack is changed to a downward slice that spawns a floating sword that attacks nearby enemies. Doing the secondary attack while the floating sword is out will recall it back to you. The Sword can be put away while the floating sword is active, and it will continue to attack enemies until you run out of Special Weapon charge.</li>
            <p class="warning">Using the floating sword ability in the Pack-a-Punch room WILL crash your game</p>
