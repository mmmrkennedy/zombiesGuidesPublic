        <p class="upgrade-title" id="acidgat">Acidgat</p>
        <p class="weapon-desc">The Acidgat is an upgraded version of the Blundergat that fires three acid bullets in a burst. These bullets stick to surfaces and enemies, exploding after a few seconds to damage both Zombies and the player. Additionally, they attract Zombies, luring them in until detonation.</p>
        <ol>
            <p class="warning">The Acidgat can do heavy damage to the player (~25-50 health for the whole burst) if they do not have PhD Slider, so standing near an acid bullet should be avoided whenever possible.</p>

        </ol>

        <p class="upgrade-title" id="magmagat">Magmagat</p>
        <p class="weapon-desc">The Magmagat is an upgraded Blundergat that launches a lava ball. When this ball sticks to a Zombie, it explodes, killing it. If shot at the ground, the ball remains for a few seconds, attracting Zombies and continuously damaging those nearby. The ball does minimal damage to the player when standing on it (~1-2 health/sec).</p>
        <ol>

Once enough essence has been collected, Zombies will no longer drop any.</li>
            <li>Deposit the essence into the Fireplace to convert the Blundergat into the Tempered Blundergat. You must pick it up within 30 seconds, or it will disappear. The Tempered Blundergat cools over time, reverting to the Blundergat. Touching <a href="pictures/blundergat/magmagat/bluebarrel_example.webp">Blue Flaming Barrels</a> resets the cooling timer.

            <li>Once all three rocks have been turned into gems, you must take the fast travel from the 'Cafeteria' to the 'Transverse Tunnel.'

                <li>Strategy: Bring the Warden to the correct location, then shoot him in the head (with a bullet gun) until his helmet pops off. You can keep shooting him if you'd like, but it can be risky if you do too much damage and kill him. If you have it equipped, use the Sword Flay Elixir now and then try to keep strafing around the pole to keep it between you and the Warden. The extra range with Ethereal Razor lets you hit the Warden through the pole while not letting him hit you.</li>

            <li>You need to have the Warden slam the ground in front of the scratched wall. You can spawn the Warden by entering "666" into the <a href="pictures/spoon/number_pad.webp">Number Pad</a> in the 'Citadel Tunnels' (this can only be done once per game). The Warden's slam attack can be triggered in two ways: </li>

                <li>Obtain <a href="#free_monkey_bomb">Monkey Bombs</a>. Wait for/Spawn the Warden. Throw a Monkey Bomb below the scratched wall and run down the stairs (No players should be near the wall with the Warden).

                <li>Starting on Round 18, the Warden will gain an electric slam attack when near a player (not recommended due to needing to wait for Round 18) </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once the Warden slams near the wall, the wall should fall, revealing the 'Warden's Ritual Room.' Activate the <a href="pictures/main_ee/shock_and_denial/electric_chair_switch.webp">switch next to the electric chair</a> and pick up the <a href="pictures/main_ee/shock_and_denial/red_stone_ritual_room.webp">Red Stone</a> from the table near the electric chair.</li>

            <li>You must spirit blast the Seagull three times, once per round. The Seagull can only be seen while aiming with the shield, but it can be heard with or without the shield.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The first seagull might only spawn in five locations, which are marked in <span class="bird-highlight-green">green</span> in the list below. If you can't find it in the locations in <span class="bird-highlight-green">green</span>, then try the spawns near those.</li>
                <li>Note: There is a way to know roughly where the Seagull is going to be for the second and third spawns. On the round before the second spawn (i.e. the round you found the first location) end the round at the top of the Gondola (the Gondola doesn't have to be there). Once you kill the last zombie, look <a href="pictures/main_ee/pain_and_guilt/aim_here_bird_step.webp">about here, out to the water</a> and wait for a subtle <a href="pictures/main_ee/pain_and_guilt/blue_light_streak_bird.webp">Blue Light Streak</a> coming from the water to shoot toward somewhere on the map. The light indicates what area of the map the Seagull has spawned: The right of your screen means it spawned in the 'Warden's Office'/'Citadel' area, Down means 'Docks,' and the left side of the screen means Spawn Area/'Catwalk.' </li>

            <li>Once the bird has been spirit blasted three times, on the following round, in addition to a Seagull squawking, a man can also be heard crying. When looking through the shield, the Bird will have been replaced with a <a href="pictures/main_ee/pain_and_guilt/white_flash.webp">white light</a> that flashes every couple of seconds. The light can only be in the locations in <span class="bird-highlight-orange">orange</span> in the list above.</li>
            <li>Obtain the <a href="#hells_retriever">Hell's Retriever</a> if you replaced it with Monkey Bombs for step 4.</li>
            <li>The Bird can now only be seen while in 'Zombie Blood.' To obtain 'Zombie Blood,' spirit blast the <a href="pictures/spoon/number_pad.webp">Number Pad</a> in 'Citadel Tunnels' and enter "872". A 'Zombie Blood' Power-up will spawn (The Temporal Gift Elixir will increase the duration of the Zombie Blood Effect).</li>
            <li>With 'Zombie Blood' active, return to the White Light and look through the shield to see if the Bird is standing on the Kronorium. <strong>DON'T look at the bird through the shield for too long, just look until the Kronorium spawns below the bird</strong>. Once you see the Kronorium spawn, quickly put away the shield and make sure no other players are in the room. Throw the Hell's Retriever at the Kronorium to make it <a href="pictures/main_ee/pain_and_guilt/kronorium_on_floor_bird.webp">appear at your feet</a>. Pickup the Kronorium.</li>
            <li><strong>Recommended but NOT required: The remainder of the Main Quest utilizes the shield a lot, so you should obtain the <a href="#attuned_spectral_shield">Attuned Spectral Shield</a> for the increased "ammo" capacity and health. Also, The Hell's Retriever is no longer required for the Main Quest (but is required for many side Easter Eggs, like the shield upgrade), so if you'd prefer to get <a href="#free_monkey_bomb">Monkey Bombs</a> it's safe to do so now.</strong></li>

                    <li>In some spots, you can stand in front of the Ghost to stop him from moving even if he's invisible to buy you some time to get another shield charge.</li>

            <li>The door will open, and all players will be put into the boss fight arena. The Warden will shake off the Ghosts and teleport away.</li>
            <li>Zombies, Hellhounds and Wardens will begin to spawn. You must get at least one shield charge from these enemies. Kill all the enemies that spawn.</li>
            <li>Once all the enemies are dead, the larger Warden will spawn somewhere in the arena with a red cylinder around him and three <a href="pictures/main_ee/reconstruction/boss_fight_red_orb.webp">red orbs</a> above him.</li>
            <li>You must quickly run into the cylinder, and shoot and destroy the orbs. Standing outside the cylinder will cause you to take damage.</li>
            <li>Once the Orbs are destroyed, wait a few seconds then spirit blast the <a href="pictures/main_ee/reconstruction/white_orb.webp">white orb above the Dark Mechanism</a>.</li>
            <li>If done correctly, the Larger Warden will disappear, and after a few seconds, Zombies will start to spawn again.</li>
            <li>Repeat one more time. During the second phase, <a href="pictures/main_ee/reconstruction/death_circle.webp">Red Circles</a> on the floor will spawn. If you are standing in them when they activate, then you will be downed instantly.</li>
            <li>After spirit blasting the white orb above the Dark Mechanism the second time, the Dark Mechanism will activate, and the player playing as Richtofen must interact with the Dark Mechanism. If no one is playing as Richtofen, a bot will spawn.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step8">Acceptance</p>
            <li>A cutscene will play and the player playing as Richtofen will respawn in the lab. They must interact with the Metal Door to enter the arena. The players, not playing as Richtofen, will face off against infinite enemies and the invincible, larger Warden until Richtofen returns to the arena. As Richtofen re-enters the arena, a small cutscene will play and the larger Warden will no longer be invincible.</li>
            <li>Kill the larger Warden. Once he is dead, the final cutscene will start.</li>
