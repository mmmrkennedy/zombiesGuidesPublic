            <li>Return to the Hermit; he will present you with a <a
                    href="pictures/main_ee/knowledge_is_power/set_of_dials.webp">set of Dials</a> for you to pick up.

                There are two ways to complete this step, the easy way and the "intended" way. These are listed below:
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>The Easy Way: Interact with each dial to spin it. When a dial is in the correct position, it will
                    make a ding sound. Do this for each dial.
                </li>
                <li>The "Intended" Way: Around the map, there will be coloured numbers drawn on walls. Each number
                    corresponds to the position a dial should be in. There is <strong>absolutely no reason</strong> to
                    do the step this way, but here are the Number locations anyway:

            </li>
            <li>You must find three Orbs around the map again. Once you find an Orb, don't get close to it, instead
                throw a snowball at it to turn it blue, then shoot it with any weapon to make it return to the Bigger
                Orb.
            </li>
            <li>Place the Seal on top of the <a href="pictures/main_ee/campfire.webp">Campfire</a> in the 'Sunken Path'

                build equipment, etc.) just not use a Pack-a-Punch Machine.</p>

            <li>Give the Seal of Duality to the Hermit. This will start a lockdown, with infinitely spawning Zombies, in
                the Lighthouse for about two minutes. You are not required to kill Zombies; you only need to wait out
                the timer.

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step7">Empower Through the Machines of the Angels</p>
            <li>You must now find where the Pack-a-Punch is and insert the Seal into it. While the Seal is in the PAP
                Machine, kill Zombies near it to charge it. Once enough Zombies are killed near the PAP, the Seal will
                pop back out for you to pick up.
            </li>
            <li>You must repeat the previous step for the other three standard PAP machines. Once you finish at one
                machine, the Lighthouse will immediately move to another PAP machine for you to use.
            </li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step8">Tame that which is Powered</p>
            <li>Once you've charged the Seal at all four PAP machines, return to 'Artifact Storage' and place the Seal

            </li>
            <li>You will have to repeat the Orb step one more time, but this time the smaller Orb will not leave the

            </li>
            <li>Place the Seal on top of the <a href="pictures/main_ee/campfire.webp">Campfire</a> in the 'Sunken Path'

            <p class="warning">Warning: Point of No Return. Once the Seal is inserted into the Golden PAP, the Boss
                Fight will start.</p>
            <li>Make your way to the Golden Pack-a-Punch iceberg and insert the Seal into the Golden PAP. Kill Zombies
                near it to charge the Seal.
            </li>
            <li>Once the Seal has been charged, the Seal will float into the air and transform the map, with any
                freezing water around the map being turned into lava. It will also create a bubble around it, which you
                must stay inside to avoid taking damage.
            </li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step10">The Infinite / Boss Fight</p>
            <li>The Seal will slowly start moving around the map, with it stopping in three locations along the way, the
                'Main Deck,' 'Lighthouse Cove,' and 'Lighthouse Station.' While the Seal is stopped, you must kill
                Zombies near it to charge it. Once charged, the screen will flash white, and Max Ammo and Carpenter
                powerups will spawn and the Seal will begin moving again.
            </li>
            <li>After stopping three times, the Seal will make its way to the top of the Lighthouse, across the zipline
                to the Facility, and finally into 'Human Infusion,' where it will stop and need to be charged again.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>While the Seal is crossing the zipline, try to use the zipline when the Seal is about halfway there
                    to avoid spending too much time outside the bubble on either side.
                </li>
                <li>While moving through the Facility, the Seal will often try to "fake you out" with the direction it
                    is going (it will start moving one way before going the other way).
                </li>
                <li>The path it takes in the Facility is: <strong>'Facility Entrance' => 'Security Lobby' =>
                    'Decontamination' => right-side walkway in 'Upper Catwalk' => 'Human Infusion'</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <li>While you are charging the Seal, the protection bubble will slowly get smaller, so charge the Seal as
                fast as possible.
            </li>
            <li>Once the Seal is charged for the final time, Zombies will stop spawning and some dialogue will begin.
                Wait for the dialogue to be over, pick up the Seal, and give it to the Hermit in the Lighthouse. Take
                the zipline from the 'Lighthouse Station' to the 'Sun Deck' and watch the Lighthouse.
            </li>
            <li>After some dialogue, the Seal will fall from the sky, landing at the <a
                    href="pictures/main_ee/the_infinite/seal_on_forecastle.webp">front of the 'Forecastle'</a> between
                the Mystery Box location and the campfire. Run over there and pick it up to start the final cutscene.
            </li>
            <li>After the cutscene is over, Samantha and Eddie will appear in a black void. You must hold forward to
                walk them toward the light, while you hear from each of our eight main characters. Once you reach the
                light, the screen will go white and the game will end.

            <li>Equip the 'Talkin' Bout Regeneration' Elixir (RECOMMENDED) <strong>AND/OR</strong> equip the 'Dying
                Wish' Perk to your loadout.

                ready.
            </li>
            <li>Make your way to the Facility Flinger, crouch, then walk on to the <a
                    href="pictures/the_secret/back_left_flinger.webp">back-left of the Flinger</a> and spin as fast as
                you can, while remaining crouched (increase controller sensitivity to at least 8).
            </li>
            <li>If done correctly, you should be launched into a faraway iceberg. Activate your elixir and start
                swimming. Keep following the path through the tunnels until you make it to the end. After a while, you
                will start taking damage (from no air).
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you have the elixir active, you will heal right back up.</li>
                <li>If you don't have the elixir, keep swimming till Dying Wish activates, then near the end of it, pull
                    out your specialist weapon for the extra armour.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once you make it to the end, you will exit the water and be presented with the Secret. There is no
                physical reward for doing this, other than an achievement. You can return to the normal map by
                interacting with the Dock.
