            <li>On the upper walkway on the 'Poop Deck', where the Sentinel Artifact was, there will be <a href="pictures/main_ee/dials/dials_poopdeck.webp">two more dials</a>. These dials don't have the symbols drawn on them; instead, they always correspond to the same symbols. The one on the <a href="pictures/main_ee/dials/dials_poopdeck_left.webp">left is the upward triangle with the line through it</a>, and the one on the <a href="pictures/main_ee/dials/dials_poopdeck_right.webp">right is the downward triangle with the line through it</a>.

            <li>Kill an elemental Catalyst matching the outlet's element next to it. If done correctly, an <a href="pictures/main_ee/outlet/orangeritualcircle.webp">orange ritual circle</a> will appear on the ground. Only one outlet can be "activated" per round, you will need to go to the next round to do another. Killing the wrong Catalyst at an outlet has no negative consequences.</li>
            <li>Once all four elements have been "activated", activate the ritual circles in the following order: <strong>Poison, Water, Electric, Fire</strong>. All players must interact with the ritual circles to start the trial. All players will be teleported to a locked-down part of the map where they must defeat all enemies.</li>
            <li>Once all the enemies have been defeated, the screen will flash grey and the players must pick up the <a href="pictures/main_ee/outlet/poison_sentinelartifact.webp">Sentinel Artifact</a> to lift the lockdown.</li>
            <li>Repeat for the other three trials. On the First and Third Trial, a max ammo will spawn</li>

            </ul>
            <li>Once all leaky pipes have been shot, the 'Turbine Room' will flood.</li>
            <li>Place the Sentinel Artifact in the Pack-a-Punch when it's in the 'Turbine Room'. It will teleport to the 'Turbine Room' the next round if it is not already there.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step6">When the Planets are Revealed, the Essence is Received</p>
            <li>Interact with the following planetary symbols in any order to activate them. When activated, the symbol will glow. Locations:</li>

            </ul>
            <li>Once all symbols are interacted with, they will disappear.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step7">Where Light Shines Not the Path Leads Inward</p>
            <li>Interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/planets_sky_pickup/solarsystemmodel_establishing.webp">Solar System Model</a> in the Cargo Hold left of the Fast Travel <strong>(Fast Travel drawn on picture due to it not being shown in Theater Mode)</strong>. It will start <a href="pictures/main_ee/planets_sky_pickup/solarsystemmodel.webp">flashing planets in a random order</a>, which you must remember.</li>
            <li>In the sky above the boat, all planets except the Moon (which is stationary) and Neptune (circling the boat in water) are visible orbiting the Sun. Shoot the planets in the order indicated by the model. After shooting a planet, a blue orb will drop from the sky, landing on the planet's symbol location where it must be collected quickly before it despawns.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Sun - <a href="pictures/main_ee/planets_sky_pickup/sun_sky.webp">Sky</a> --- <a href="pictures/main_ee/planets_sky_pickup/sun_pickup.webp">Orb Pickup</a> --- Shoot from the 'Forecastle' (Spawn)</li>

                <li>Saturn - <a href="pictures/main_ee/planets_sky_pickup/saturn_sky.webp">Sky</a> --- <a href="pictures/main_ee/planets_sky_pickup/saturn_pickup.webp">Orb Pickup</a> --- Shoot from the 'Bridge'</li>

            </ul>
            <li>Note: There is no time limit between shooting the planets, but there is a time limit to pick the orb dropped by the planet. So you can take as long as you want to shoot a planet, but once it's shot, the timer starts. If an orb does despawn, or you shoot the wrong planet, you must go to the next round and interact with the Solar System Model in the 'Cargo Hold' again.</li>
            <li><strong>DO NOT SHOOT DOWN THE SUN</strong>. The Sun is always the last "planet" in the sequence, and picking up its orb will activate a timed challenge. Make sure you have an upgraded Kraken or some other high DPS weapon (Like the Hellion Salvo) and max ammo.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step8">Unto the Nest its Malice Unravels</p>
            <li>All players must interact with the Sun's orb at the same time. Once the Sun's orb is picked up, the screen will flash grey, <a href="pictures/main_ee/ice_blocks/blockofice.webp">blocks of ice</a> will spawn blocking various stairs and doorways, and zombies will start spawning infinitely.</li>
            <li>You must damage the ice blocks to destroy them with your goal being to destroy the <a href="pictures/main_ee/ice_blocks/final_ice.webp">final ice block</a> on the 'Poop Deck'.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Once the <a href="pictures/main_ee/ice_blocks/maxammo_ice.webp">ice block on the 'Promenade Port Deck'</a> is destroyed (about the halfway point), it will spawn a max ammo.</li>
                <li>The boat is slowly being engulfed by a freezing effect moving from front to back. If the you take too long to destroy the ice blocks, the screen will start to freeze and staying too long like this will cause you to fail the challenge.</li>
                <li>If you fail the challenge, you can try again by interacting with the Sun's Orb next round.</li>
                <li>Note: Once the final ice block is destroyed, the challenge is complete, no matter how many other ice blocks were destroyed. So you can "skip" all the ice blocks near the back of the ship if you shoot the final ice block from the 'Aft Decks' mystery box location. This is <strong>not recommended Solo</strong> unless you have the Hellion Salvo and the Homunculus.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="warning">Warning: Point of No Return. Once the ritual circle is interacted with, the Boss Fight will start.</p>
            <li>Once the final ice block is destroyed, the screen will flash grey and a <a href="pictures/main_ee/boss_fight/orange_ritual_boss.webp">ritual circle</a> will spawn where the ice block was.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step9">Behold the Eye of Malice and Despair</p>
            <p><strong>Recommended Weapons</strong>: <a href="#kraken">Kraken</a> (<a href="#kraken_variant">Water Upgrade</a>) and Hellion Salvo</p>
            <li>All players must interact with the ritual circle at the same time to be teleported underwater where you must swim to the <a href="pictures/main_ee/boss_fight/sentinelartifact_iceberg.webp">Sentinel Artifact</a> and interact with it.</li>

            <p class="sub-sub-step">Phase 1</p>
            <li>You will be teleported back to the 'Poop Deck' where an Iceberg will raise out of the water, and a large eye will spawn and start teleporting around.</li>
            <li>Zombies, Catalysts, Stokers, and Blightfathers will spawn which all need to be killed for you to progress.</li>
            <li>Once all the enemies are killed, the screen will flash white, and after a few seconds you will be teleported again. Make sure to pick up the Max Ammo and Carpenter drops at the back of the ship before being teleported.</li>

            <p class="sub-sub-step">Phase 2</p>
            <li>You will be teleported to the 'Engine Room' where you must kill all the enemies again.</li>

            <p class="sub-sub-step">Phase 3</p>
            <li>You will then be teleported to the 'State Rooms' where, instead of killing all the enemies again, you must shoot the Eye until the screen flashes white.</li>
            <li>The Eye can only be shot while it is doing its laser attack. Stay out of the long hallways to avoid the laser and peak around the corner when it's time to do damage.</li>
            <li>Once enough damage has been done, the screen will flash white, and after a few seconds the players will be teleported again.</li>

            <p class="sub-sub-step">Phase 4</p>
            <li>The players will then be teleported to the 'Promenade Starboard Deck' where, similar to the 'State Rooms', the players can only shoot the Eye when it is shooting it laser beam.</li>
            <li>Once enough damage has been done, the screen will flash white, and after a few seconds the players will be teleported again.</li>

            <p class="sub-sub-step">Phase 5</p>
            <li>The players will be teleported back to the 'Poop Deck'. Same as in the 'State Rooms' and 'Promenade Starboard Deck', the Eye can only be damaged while it's using the laser, but now there is a new attack.</li>
            <li>The Eye will start shaking and a charging sound will play. You must quickly do enough damage to stun the Eye before it finishes charges or all players will be instantly downed. The Dying Wish Perk can be used to avoid going down, and level 3 Scepter of Ra can be used to instantly revive anyone inside with all perks.</li>
            <li>Once enough damage has been done to the Eye, it will explode, the screen will go white, and the final cutscene will begin.</li>

            <li>Follow the Hourglass as it moves around the ship. The Hourglass only moves when a player is close to it and failing to move it quickly will cause the Hourglass to despawn and this step can be tried again next round.</li>
