                    <li>
                        All players must interact with the ritual circle at the same time to be teleported underwater where you must swim to the

                        and interact with it.
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I don't know if you can drown here, as it seems the game will constantly give you a refill on air but, this could (speculation on my part) eventually stop to avoid AFKing here.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="boss-fight-phases">Phase 1</p>
                    <li>You will be teleported back to the 'Poop Deck' where an Iceberg will rise out of the water. After a few seconds, a large eye will spawn and start teleporting around.</li>
                    <li>Zombies, Catalysts, Stokers, and Blightfathers will spawn which all need to be killed for you to progress.</li>
                    <li>Once all the enemies are killed, the screen will flash white, and after a few seconds, you will be teleported again. Make sure to pick up the Max Ammo and Carpenter drops at the back of the ship before being teleported.</li>

                    <p class="boss-fight-phases">Phase 2</p>
                    <li>You will be teleported to the 'Engine Room' where you must kill all the enemies again.</li>
                    <li>Again, make sure to pick up the power-ups before you're teleported.</li>

                    <p class="boss-fight-phases">Phase 3</p>
                    <li>You will then be teleported to the 'State Rooms' where, instead of needing to kill all the enemies, you must shoot the Eye until the screen goes white.</li>
                    <li>The Eye can only be shot while it is doing its laser attack. Stay out of the long hallways to avoid the laser and peak around the corner when it's time to do damage.</li>
                    <li>Once enough damage has been done, the screen will flash white, power-ups will spawn, and you'll be teleported again.</li>

                    <p class="boss-fight-phases">Phase 4</p>
                    <li>The players will then be teleported to the 'Promenade Starboard Deck' where similar to the 'State Rooms,' the players can only shoot the Eye when it is shooting its laser beam.</li>
                    <li>Once enough damage has been done, the screen will flash white, and you'll be teleported again.</li>

                    <p class="boss-fight-phases">Phase 5</p>
                    <li>The players will be teleported back to the 'Poop Deck.' Same as in the 'State Rooms' and 'Promenade Starboard Deck,' the Eye can only be damaged while it's using the laser, but now there is a new attack.</li>
                    <li>The Eye will start shaking and a charging sound will play. You must quickly do enough damage to stun the Eye before it finishes charges or all players will be instantly downed.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Dying Wish Perk can be used to avoid going down, and the level 3 Scepter of Ra can be used to instantly revive anyone inside with all perks.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Once enough damage has been done to the Eye, it will explode, the screen will go white, and the final cutscene will begin.</li>
