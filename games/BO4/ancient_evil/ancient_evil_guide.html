            <li>You must melee these glowing items to reveal the Dormant Hand inside, after which you can pick it up.</li>
            <li>The Oracle will often hint to the player where a Dormant Hand can be found when the player is in the 'Temple of Apollo' anytime after unlocking Pack-a-Punch.</li>

                <li>You must hit all roots in a set with one shot from the Hand of Gaia (the "auto-aim" of the Gaia shot will hit all roots when aimed correctly).</li>
                <li>Once all three sets are shot, a Gegenees will spawn which <b>YOU SHOULD NOT KILL</b> as it can be used for the next step. It's fine if you kill it, as it is not required for the next step, it just makes it easier.</li>
                <li>If you do kill the Gegenees, it will drop a <a href="pictures/main_ee/">Golden Pole</a> for you to pick up.</li>
                <li>Sets of Roots: </li>
                <ol>
                    <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/">First Root - Left of Danu, outside the map</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/">Second Set - Around Danu statue</a></li>
                    <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/">Third Set - Inbetween the Danu statue and the Mystery Box location</a></li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
            <li>In the 'Intersections of Treasuries', bait a Gegenees into Shield Blasting the <a href="pictures/main_ee/">Ankh</a> trapped in the crystal. If done correctly, the Ankh will fall to the floor where you can pick it up.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you used the Gegenees from the previous step, you can now kill it. Once killed, it will drop a <a href="pictures/main_ee/">Golden Pole</a> for you to pick up.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>In the 'Offering of the Attalids', place the Golden Pole (dropped by the Gegenees spawned in step 12) in the <a href="pictures/main_ee/">Gold Sundial</a> on the floor.</li>
            <li>Kill an Electric Catalyst while it's standing on the Sundial to activate it. This will cause one of the "windows" to open revealing a rotating dial with symbols, one of which is blue.</li>
            <li>You must stop the dial when the blue symbol is underneath the <a href="pictures/main_ee/">Glowing Line</a> by interacting with the Golden Pole. Based on the number of positions from the open window to the line, you will have to "guess" when to stop the dial.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This must be repeated, from step 15, two more times for the other two dials.</li>
                <li>If you fail, the screen will flash white, and you can retry CHANGE ME.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Interact with the Ra perk statue to give him the Ankh.</li>
            <li>Obtain the <a href="#redeemed_hand_of_hemera" class="link-to-page">Redeemed Hand of Hemera</a> and (NOT REQUIRED) the <a href="#pegasus_strike" class="link-to-page">Pegasus Strike</a></li>
            <li>While holding the Redeemed Hand of Hemera, interact with the statue of Ra to give it to him. This will cause a beam to fire at the wall on the other side of the room. You must defend the beam from skeletons, who will stand in front of the beam, blocking it. Zombies and Blightfathers will also start spawning.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you fail to defend the beam, the Hand of Hemera will respawn at its shrine where you can pick it up and try again.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once the beam has been defended for long enough, the wall it was targeting will break away to reveal the <a href="pictures/main_ee/">Scepter of Ra</a>. Pick up the Scepter and give it to the Statue of Ra.</li>

            <li>All players must obtain a <a href="#god_hand_weapon" class="link-to-page">Redeemed Hand Weapon</a>. Once all players have a Redeemed Hand, navigate to the 'Amphitheater' and stand on the glowing circles on the floor corresponding to the colour of each player's God Hand. Once all players are standing on their circle (called "Home Circle" from now on), a minigame will start where the players must kill specific zombies using their God Hand. A detailed description of one round is below:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Once the game has started, 1-4 glowing circles will appear on the floor on the 'Amphitheater'. The corresponding player must run to the circle and stand on it. There can be rounds where a Hand doesn't have a circle to stand on, in that case that player should stay on the "Home Circle" and not move.</li>
                <li>While a player is standing on the new circle in the middle of the 'Amphitheater', Zombies, matching the colour of the hand, will spawn either somewhere in the stands or on the floor. The players must shoot their corresponding Zombies with different shots, depending on where the Zombies are standing. The ones in the stands must be killed with a regular shot of the Hand and the Zombies on the floor must be killed with a charged shot of the Hand.</li>
                <li>Once the Zombies are killed, one of two things will happen, either the glowing circle will move to somewhere else in the middle of the 'Amphitheater' or the player's screen will go black and white. If the circle moves to somewhere in the arena, the player must run to it and play again. If the screen goes black and white, the player will have to run back to the "Home Circle".</li>
                <li>A round ends will all player's screens go black and white, and they are sent back to their "Home Circles".</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If a player doesn't kill their Zombies quick enough or a player uses the incorrect attack, all players will fail that round. If the players fail three of the five rounds, the game will end and the players can retry next round.</li>
                    <li>If the players complete three of the five rounds successfully, the screen will flash white and the players will be rewarded with a Max Ammo powerup and several Free Points powerups.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <li>Locate the <a href="pictures/main_ee/">door</a> to the right of the Spitfire wallbuy in the 'River of Sorrow'. The symbols on the door must be shot with a bullet-based weapon in <a href="pictures/main_ee/door_symbols.png">this order</a>.</li>
            <li>Once the symbols are correctly shot, players playing as Shaw and Bruno must interact with the door to start a short cutscene. If only Shaw or Bruno is in the game, that player interacts with the door. If neither is present, any player can interact, but no cutscene will play.</li>
            <li>Obtain the <a href="#pegasus_strike" class="link-to-page">Pegasus Strike</a></li>
            <li>Navigate to the top of the stairs in the 'River of Sorrow' and place the Pegasus Strike the <a href="pictures/main_ee/">blue glowing symbol</a>.</li>
