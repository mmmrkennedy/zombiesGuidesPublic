            <li>You must melee these glowing items to reveal the Dormant Hand inside, after which you can pick it up.</li>
            <li>The Oracle will often hint to the player where a Dormant Hand can be found when the player is in the 'Temple of Apollo' anytime after unlocking Pack-a-Punch.</li>

            <li>Ignite the <a href="#eternal_flame">Eternal Flame</a> and obtain the <a href="#apollos_will">Apollo's Will</a></li>
            <li>Throughout the Main Quest, you will need to obtain the Fallen version of the Hand of Gaia and the Redeemed versions of the others to complete various steps. Make sure to keep it in mind while going through the steps. Also, for one of the steps, all players must acquire a Redeemed Hand, but by that point, you will already have one Fallen, and two Redeemed Hands. The Hands will be needed in the following order at the following steps:
                <ol>
                    <li><a href="#redeemed_hand_of_charon">Redeemed Hand of Charon</a> - Step 6</li>

                    <li><a href="#redeemed_hand_of_ouranos">Redeemed Hand of Ouranos</a> - Step 21/24</li>
                </ol>
            <li>Ignite the spear of the Apollo's Will with the Eternal Flame by meleeing the flame with the Spear in the 'Temple of Apollo.' While the Shield is on fire, it will slowly take damage. If you put away the shield while it is one fire, the fire will go out, and you will have to melee the eternal flame to reignite it.</li>
            <li>Locate three Oil Spills and set them ablaze by meleeing them with the Flaming Spear of Apollo's Will.</li>
            <ul>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step3">Look the Dead in the Eye</p>
            <li>Obtain the <a href="#redeemed_hand_of_charon">Redeemed Hand of Charon</a></li>
            <li>In the 'Spartan Monument' area, shoot a charged hand of Charon shot at the <a href="pictures/main_ee/look_the_dead_in_the_eye/ground_in_front_zeus.webp">ground in front of the Zeus Perk Statue</a>.</li>
            <li>While standing in the blood pool, your screen will go black and white, and one of the ten statues around you will have <a href="pictures/main_ee/look_the_dead_in_the_eye/glowing_eyes.webp">glowing eyes</a>. Shoot it with an uncharged shot of the Hand of Charon. If done correctly, the statue should be break apart and disappear. Repeat for three more statues.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step4">Align the Citizens</p>
            <li>Using any bullet-based weapon, shoot the walls (locations below) to reveal a <a href="pictures/main_ee/align_the_citizens/gears_example.webp">Set of Gears</a> – one small and one large. Stop the moving gear by throwing the Spear from Apollo's Will when it's touching the stationary gear. This will engage the gears, causing the stationary one to spin. Time your Spear throws so the gears are touching when you stop the small gear.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/align_the_citizens/gears_intersection_2.webp">Intersections of Treasuries - Outside the map, left of the Auger DMR wallbuy</a></li>

            </ul>
            <li>Once all three gear sets are spinning, navigate to the 'Stoa of Athenians' where you must throw a Spear at <a href="pictures/main_ee/align_the_citizens/where_to_throw.webp">this area</a> right when the three statues in the middle are facing the White Crystal. If done correctly, the statues will stop spinning and the crystal will rise to meet the beam of light.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step5">Scepter and Sundial</p>
            <li>Obtain the <a href="#hand_of_gaia">Fallen Hand of Gaia</a></li>
            <li>In the 'Offering of the Attalids', there will be a <a href="pictures/main_ee/scepter_and_sundial/root_1.webp">Glowing Root</a> on a wall outside the map, left of the Danu perk statue. When shot, with the Hand of Gaia, a new set of roots will spawn.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>After you shoot one set of roots, you must quickly shoot the new roots that spawn, or they will despawn, and you will have to restart with the first set.</li>
                <li>You must hit all roots in a set with one shot from the Hand of Gaia (the "auto-aim" of the Gaia shot will hit all roots when aimed correctly).</li>
                <li>Once all three sets are shot, a Gegenees will spawn which <strong>YOU SHOULD NOT KILL</strong> as it can be used for the next step. It's fine if you kill it, as it is not required for the next step, it just makes it easier.</li>
                <li>If you do kill the Gegenees, it will drop a <a href="pictures/main_ee/scepter_and_sundial/golden_pole.webp">Golden Pole</a> for you to pick up.</li>
                <li>Sets of Roots - <a href="https://youtu.be/KmaMNTEHwQo">Video Example (Youtube)</a>: </li>
                <ol>
                    <li>First Root - Left of Danu, outside the map</li>
                    <li>Second Set - Around Danu statue</li>
                    <li>Third Set - Inbetween the Danu statue and the Mystery Box location</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
            <li>In the 'Intersections of Treasuries', bait a Gegenees into Shield Blasting the <a href="pictures/main_ee/scepter_and_sundial/ankh.webp">Ankh</a> trapped in the crystal. If done correctly, the Ankh will fall to the floor where you can pick it up.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you used the Gegenees from the previous step, you can now kill it. Once killed, it will drop a <a href="pictures/main_ee/scepter_and_sundial/golden_pole.webp">Golden Pole</a> for you to pick up.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>In the 'Offering of the Attalids', place the Golden Pole (dropped by the Gegenees spawned in step 12) in the <a href="pictures/main_ee/scepter_and_sundial/gold_sundial.webp">Gold Sundial</a> on the floor.</li>
            <li>Kill an Electric Catalyst while it's standing on the Sundial to activate it. This will cause one of the "windows" to open revealing a rotating dial with symbols, one of which is blue.</li>
            <li>You must stop the dial when the blue symbol is underneath the <a href="pictures/main_ee/scepter_and_sundial/glowing_line.webp">Glowing Line</a> by interacting with the Golden Pole. Based on the number of positions from the open window to the line, you will have to "guess" when to stop the dial.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This must be repeated, from step 15, two more times for the other two dials.</li>
                <li>If you fail, the screen will flash white, and you can retry immediately from step 15.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Interact with the Ra perk statue to give him the Ankh.</li>
            <li>Obtain the <a href="#redeemed_hand_of_hemera">Redeemed Hand of Hemera</a> (Required) and the <a href="#pegasus_strike">Pegasus Strike</a> (Recommended)</li>
            <li>While holding the Redeemed Hand of Hemera, interact with the statue of Ra to give it to him. This will cause a beam to fire at the wall on the other side of the room. You must defend the beam from skeletons, who will try to stand in front of the beam on either side of the pool, blocking it. If the beam is blocked for long enough (~5-10 seconds total), Ra will stop shooting the beam and you will fail.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Infinite Zombies and Blightfathers will also start spawning.</li>
                <li>If you have the Pegasus Strike, place it down just outside the room, by the 'Intersections of Treasuries.'</li>
                <li>If you fail to defend the beam, the Hand of Hemera will respawn at its shrine where you can pick it up and try again.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once the beam has been defended for long enough, the wall it was targeting will break away to reveal the <a href="pictures/main_ee/scepter_and_sundial/scepter_of_ra.webp">Scepter of Ra</a>. Pick up the Scepter and give it to the Statue of Ra.</li>


            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step6">Hit Your Marks</p>
            <li>All players must obtain a <a href="#god_hand_weapon">Redeemed Hand Weapon</a>. Once all players have a Redeemed Hand, navigate to the 'Amphitheater' and stand on the <a href="pictures/main_ee/hit_your_marks/home_circle.webp">glowing circles</a> on the floor corresponding to the colour of each player's God Hand. Once all players are standing on their circle (called "Home Circle" from now on), a minigame will start where the players must kill specific zombies using their God Hand. A detailed description of a round is below:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Once the game has started, 1–4 glowing circles will appear on the floor on the 'Amphitheater.' The corresponding player must run to the circle and stand on it. There can be rounds where a player doesn't have a circle to stand on, in that case that player should stay on the "Home Circle" and not move.</li>
                <li>While a player is standing on the new circle, Zombies matching the colour of the hand, will spawn either somewhere in the stands or on the floor. The players must shoot their corresponding Zombies with different shots, depending on where the Zombies are standing. The ones in the stands must be killed with a regular shot of the Hand, and the Zombies on the floor must be killed with a charged shot of the Hand. You can move around to get a better angle on the zombies if needed.</li>
                <li>Once the Zombies are killed, one of two things will happen, either the glowing circle will move to somewhere else in the middle of the 'Amphitheater' or the player's screen will go black and white. If the circle moves to somewhere in the arena, the player must run to it and play again. If the screen goes black and white, the player will have to run back to the "Home Circle."</li>
                <li>A round ends will all player's screens go black and white, and they are sent back to their "Home Circles."</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If a player doesn't kill their Zombies quick enough or a player uses the incorrect attack, all players will fail that round. If the players fail three of the five rounds, the game will end and the players can retry the next round.</li>
                    <li>If the players complete three of the five rounds successfully, the screen will flash white and the players will be rewarded with a Max Ammo powerup and several Free Points powerups.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step7">Cleanse the Center</p>
            <li>Locate the <a href="pictures/main_ee/cleanse_the_center/door.webp">door</a> to the right of the Spitfire wallbuy in the 'River of Sorrow'. The symbols on the door must be shot with a bullet-based weapon in <a href="pictures/main_ee/door_symbols.webp">this order</a>.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you shoot the wrong symbol, all the symbols will go out and you can retry immediately.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>If the characters Shaw and Bruno are both in the game, they must interact with the door to start a short cutscene. If only one of them is present, that player interacts with the door. If neither is in the game, any player can interact with the door, but no cutscene will play.</li>
            <li>Obtain the <a href="#pegasus_strike">Pegasus Strike</a> and <a href="#redeemed_hand_of_ouranos">Redeemed Hand of Ouranos</a> if you haven't already.</li>
            <li>Navigate to the top of the stairs in the 'River of Sorrow' and place the Pegasus Strike the <a href="pictures/main_ee/cleanse_the_center/blue_symbol.webp">blue glowing symbol</a>. This will cause pegasus to lift a giant ballista out of the ground.</li>
            <li>Once the ballista is fully out of the ground, shoot it with a charged shot of the Redeemed Hand of Ouranos until it is lined up with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/cleanse_the_center/gap_in_railing.webp">opening in the railing</a> by where the blue symbol was.</li>
            <li>Ignite the spear of Apollo's Will at the fire in 'Temple of Apollo', then quickly make your way back to the "Dark Side". With the burning spear, you must run through the <a href="pictures/main_ee/cleanse_the_center/acid_trap.webp">Acid Trap</a> in 'Python Pass'. If done correctly, the spear should have green fire on it.</li>
            <li>Melee the ballista at the top of the stairs, with the spear to ignite it. This will cause the ballista to shoot an arrow.</li>

            <p class="warning">Warning: Point of No Return. Once the Portal is interacted with, the Boss Fight will start.</p>

            <li>A portal will spawn <a href="pictures/main_ee/cleanse_the_center/portal_behind_pap.webp">behind Pack-a-Punch</a>. All players must interact with it at the same time to start the Boss Fight.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step8">Boss Fight</p>
            <li>The Boss Fight consists of two phases, fighting Pegasus and then fighting Perseus. In the arena, there are three floating islands that you can move between using jump pads and one pillar in the middle where Perseus is, which you can't access.</li>
            <li>To kill Pegasus, you must shoot it while it is flying over one of the islands. If enough damage is done, it will fall to the ground and start <a href="pictures/main_ee/cleanse_the_center/orange_pegasus.webp">glowing orange</a>. While Pegasus is glowing orange, you can only do damage with your specialist weapon.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you don't do enough damage to Pegasus while it is flying over an island, it will drop Fire/Electricity on the island which will stay on the ground for a few seconds. These attacks are quite easy to avoid, assuming you don't stand directly under Pegasus.</li>
                <li>Occasionally, Perseus will throw flaming spears at you that will leave fire on the ground.</li>
                <li>If you stand in the fire, it will damage you but will also charge your specialist weapon very quickly.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once you do enough damage to Pegasus, it will destroy the 'Mount Olympus: Forest' island and spawn a Max Ammo Powerup on one of the other islands.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If a player is on the island while it is being destroyed, they will be downed instantly with no opportunity to revive. If you are Solo, this will end the game.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Repeat Step 31 one more time. Once you do enough damage to Pegasus, Pegasus will now attack Perseus.</li>
            <li>Perseus will then destroy the 'Mount Olympus: Fountains' island, leaving only the 'Mount Olympus: Columns' island. Once the island is destroyed, the fight with Perseus will start.</li>
            <li>Perseus will stand on the pillar in the middle of the arena, occasionally teleporting to your island where he will attack you, and you can damage him with any weapon. If you do enough damage, Perseus will start glowing Orange, like Pegasus did, allowing you to damage him with your Specialist Weapon.</li>
            <li>Repeat this until he dies and drops a <a href="pictures/main_ee/cleanse_the_center/key.webp">key</a>. Pick up the key to end the Boss Fight and start the final cutscene.</li>
