                <p class="weapon-desc">There are four God Hand Weapons, each corresponding to a Greek God (Charon, Ouranos, Hemera and Gaia). The Hand Weapons can't be directly Pack-a-Punched, but there are three versions, "Fallen"/Base version, "Redeemed"/Upgraded and "Exalted"/Fully Upgraded.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>To craft a God Hand, you'll first need to find one of four Dormant Hands, all of which spawn at the beginning of the game.</li>
                    <li>Each Dormant Hand is hidden inside something (Vase, Pile of Dirt, Crystal, etc.) Items containing a Dormant Hand will glow purple if a Hand is present.</li>
                    <li>You must melee these glowing items to reveal the Dormant Hand inside, after which you can pick it up.</li>
                    <li>The Oracle will often hint to the player where a Dormant Hand can be found when the player is in the 'Temple of Apollo' anytime after unlocking Pack-a-Punch.</li>
                    <li>The Oracle will only hint at one location until the Hand at that location is picked up.</li>
                    <li>Below is a table of the location of a Dormant Hand based on the Hint the Oracle gives.</li>
                    <li>You don't have to pick up the Hand at the location being hinted at.</li>
                    <li>The hint the Oracle says will always start with "Seek the Primordial Weapon..." followed by the location. Example: "Seek the Primordial Weapon near the Purple Blossoms."</li>

                        <a href="#god_hand_weapon" class="link-to-page">Redeemed Hand Weapon</a>. Once all players have a Redeemed Hand, navigate to the 'Amphitheater' and stand on the
                        <a href="pictures/main_ee/hit_your_marks/home_circle.webp">glowing circles</a>
                        on the floor corresponding to the colour of each player's God Hand. Once all players are standing in their circle (called "Home Circle" from now on), a minigame will start where the players must kill specific zombies using their God Hand. A detailed description of a round is below:
                    </li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Once the game has started, 1–4 glowing circles will appear on the floor of the 'Amphitheater.' The corresponding player must run to the circle and stand on it. There can be rounds where a player doesn't have a circle to stand on, in that case, that player should stay on the "Home Circle" and not move.</li>
                        <li>While a player is standing on the new circle, Zombies matching the colour of the hand will spawn either somewhere in the stands or on the floor. The players must shoot their corresponding Zombies with different shots, depending on where the Zombies are standing. The ones in the stands must be killed with a regular shot of the Hand, and the Zombies on the floor must be killed with a charged shot of the Hand. You can move around to get a better angle on the zombies if needed.</li>
                        <li>Once the Zombies are killed, one of two things will happen, either the glowing circle will move to somewhere else in the middle of the 'Amphitheater' or the player's screen will go black and white. If the circle moves to somewhere in the arena, the player must run to it and play again. If the screen goes black and white, the player will have to run back to the "Home Circle."</li>
                        <li>A round ends with all players' screens going black and white, and they are sent back to their "Home Circles."</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If a player doesn't kill their Zombies quickly enough or a player uses the incorrect attack, all players will fail that round. If the players fail three of the five rounds, the game will end and the players can retry the next round.</li>
                            <li>If the players complete three of the five rounds successfully, the screen will flash white and the players will be rewarded with a Max Ammo power-up and several Free Points power-ups.</li>

                    <li>
                        To kill Pegasus, you must shoot it while it is flying over one of the islands. If enough damage is done, it will fall to the ground and start

                    <ul>
                        <li>If a player is on the island while it is being destroyed, they will be downed instantly with no opportunity to revive. If you're Solo, this will end the game.</li>

                    <li>Perseus will then destroy the 'Mount Olympus: Fountains' island, leaving only the 'Mount Olympus: Columns' island. Once the island is destroyed, the fight with Perseus will start.</li>
                    <li>Perseus will stand on the pillar in the middle of the arena, occasionally teleporting to your island where he will attack you, and you can damage him with any weapon.
