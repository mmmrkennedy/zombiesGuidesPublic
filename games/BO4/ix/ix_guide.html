            <p class="warning">Read the entirety of the following step before continuing as it's quite complicated to explain.</p>
            <li>Once all four Gladiators have been killed, navigate to the 'Ra Altar Room.' All players must interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/answer_the_dawn/symbol_on_obelisk.webp">symbol on the Obelisk</a> to start a lockdown event in the 'Ra Altar Room.' Four symbols will appear one at a time in order on the Obelisk, each of which <a href="pictures/main_ee/answer_the_dawn/ra_enemy_key.webp">represents a special enemy</a>. The players must kill the special enemies in the same order they appeared on the Obelisk. Killing an incorrect special enemy or one out of order will result in a fail. If done successfully, the screen will flash white and all enemies will be killed. This has to be repeated one more time.</li>
            <li>If both lockdowns were completed successfully, the <a href="pictures/main_ee/answer_the_dawn/eight_symbols.webp">Obelisk will have eight symbols on it</a>.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step4">Summon the Storm</p>
            <li>All players must interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/summon_the_storm/stone_challengepodium.webp">Stone</a> in the middle of the 'Challenge Podium.' All players will be teleported underground and be locked down there until the next step is completed.</li>
            <li>Shoot four poles around the underground to make them spin and rise until they don't go up or spin any more: </li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/summon_the_storm/odin_tunnel_pole.webp">Odin Tunnel</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/summon_the_storm/cursed_room_pole.webp">Cursed Room</a></li>

                <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/summon_the_storm/collapsed_tunnel_pole.webp">The Collapsed Tunnel</a></li>
            </ul>
            <li>In the 'Arena,' on the ground near each of the walls, there will be four <a href="pictures/main_ee/summon_the_storm/electrical_circles.webp">electrical circles</a> with poles near them. Using a weapon equipped with the Kill-O-Watt, kill enemies that are stunned with Kill-O-Watt while they are inside the circle (You can use the Kill-O-Watt weapon to kill the stunned zombies, you don't have to kill them with a different weapon). Note: Only killing the Zombies with a weapon equipped with Kill-O-Watt is not enough, the Zombies need to be stunned when killed. Also, the Gladiators and Brawlers count for half the required kills, so killing two gladiators will fill a circle.</li>
            <li>Once a circle has been charged, its corresponding <a href="pictures/main_ee/summon_the_storm/electrified_pole.webp">pole will become electrified</a> and an <a href="pictures/main_ee/summon_the_storm/orb_over_challengebowl.webp">orb will spawn above the closest challenge bowl</a>. Once all four orbs have spawned, all players must interact with an orb at the same time.</li>
            <li>A lockdown event will start in the 'Arena' where infinite Brawlers, Gladiators and Tigers will spawn. The players must survive until the event ends, killing all the enemies is not required. During the event, the player's special weapons will also be infinite.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step5">Channel the Flood</p>
            <li>Nine blue symbols will spawn in the underground part of the map. Using the Death of Orion, the player needs to shoot three symbols at the same time with one shot (this is often done by shooting through walls to hit other symbols). If done correctly, the symbols should stay lit up and a sound should play. The nine symbols are grouped into sets of three: </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Danu Tunnel</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Aim <a href="pictures/main_ee/channel_the_flood/blue_symbols/danutunnel_aimhere.webp">here</a> and shoot at the highest point in the jump. --- <a href="https://youtu.be/eH92OEjtRns">Video Example</a></li>
                </ul>
                <li>The Pit</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shoot at the <a href="pictures/main_ee/channel_the_flood/blue_symbols/thepit_aimhere.webp">middle of the symbol</a>. --- <a href="https://youtu.be/5oMTtaOl-6M">Video Example</a></li>
                </ul>
                <li>The Crypts</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Aim just below the <a href="pictures/main_ee/channel_the_flood/blue_symbols/thecrypts_aimhere.webp">bottom left curve</a>. (<a href="pictures/main_ee/channel_the_flood/blue_symbols/thecrypts_aimhere_edited.webp">Brightened and Zoomed in</a>) --- <a href="https://youtu.be/_s-w2ZOT1UI">Video Example</a></li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Navigate to 'The Pit' and have all players stand on this <a href="pictures/main_ee/channel_the_flood/metal_plate.webp">Metal Plate</a> for about 20 seconds. After 20 Seconds, the screen will go white, and a lockdown event will start in 'The Pit.' The players must kill all the waves of enemies. Once all waves are complete, a <a href="pictures/main_ee/channel_the_flood/key.webp">Key</a> will spawn beneath the grate on the floor for the player to pick up.</li>

            <p class="warning">Warning: Point of No Return. Once the portal is interacted with, the Boss Fight will start.</p>
            <li>In the 'Arena,' a <a href="pictures/main_ee/boss_fight/bossfight_portal.webp">portal</a> will spawn on the other side of the gate opposite the gate the player entered from at the beginning of the game.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step6">Fury & Wrath Elephant Boss Fight</p>
            <li>Once the players enter the portal, they will be teleported to the Boss Fight Arena. The players must survive waves of Tigers and Gladiators.</li>
            <li>Max Ammo drops are common, they drop from killing any enemy and don't despawn from timing out.</li>
            <li>Once all Tigers and Gladiators are defeated, the elephant Fury will come out of the left side gate. Fury has a few attacks, it will charge and stomp, it will swing its tusks around, and it will just stomp if a player gets too close. The gladiators riding on Fury's back can throw spears at the player.</li>
            <li>Shoot the <a href="pictures/main_ee/boss_fight/side_of_elephant.webp">red spots on the sides of the armour</a> to break it.</li>
            <li>Once the armour is broken, shoot it in the forehead till it dies. Also, once the armour is broken, Fury will gain another attack. It will stomp shooting out fire spikes that will follow a player and insta-down them. This can be avoided by making the spikes hit the shield or just sprinting away until they are gone.</li>
            <li>Once Fury dies, Wrath will spawn which is identical to Fury. Once Wrath dies, the boss fight will end and the final cutscene will start.</li>
