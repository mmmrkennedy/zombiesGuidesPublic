            <li>In the 'Mausoleum,' kill ~15 vampires. After every successful kill, you should hear the ghost lady scream. If you do not hear a scream, try getting the kills while standing on each of the white circles until one works.</li>

            <li>If done correctly, it will sink into the Mausoleum and a telescope will take its place. The telescope should shoot a beam of light toward the Atlas Statue in the Mansion.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step1_libra">Libra</p>
            <li>On the 'North Atrium Bridge,' there will be three <a href="pictures/main_ee/telescope/boxes.webp">boxes</a> on the railing facing the Atlas Statue that will open when a player gets close to them. Open all the boxes to reveal the wheels inside.</li>
            <li>The goal is to block the three coloured beams coming from the crystal in the middle using the circular part of the rings. The wheels can be spun left by interacting with the left side or to the right by interacting with the right. When the wheels are spun, the rings Atlas is holding will spin. The easiest way to block all beams is:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Spin the <strong>Middle Wheel</strong> to the <strong>Left</strong> until the <span class="bird-highlight-green">Green light</span> is covered</li>
                <li>Spin the <strong>Left Wheel</strong> to the <strong>Left</strong> until the <span style="color:cornflowerblue">Blue light</span> is covered (this will uncover the green light)</li>
                <li>Spin the <strong>Right wheel</strong> to the <strong>Left</strong> until the <span style="color:red">Red light</span> is covered</li>
                <li><i>Repeat Steps 1–3 until all lights are covered</i></li>

            <li>Once all lights are covered, the beams will melt the statue's head off.</li>

            <li>Around the 'Cemetery,' there will be a tombstone with one of the characters and the year "1912" on it. If solo, interact with the tombstone to activate "Green Vision". If co-op, only the player playing as the character shown on the tombstone can activate "Green Vision", if that character is not in the game, anyone can activate it.</li>
            <li>In the Green Vision, the five branches will form an effigy. You must shoot a <a href="pictures/main_ee/effigy/charged_fireball.webp">Charged Fireball Shot</a> from Alistair's Annihilator at the base of the effigy and hold interact on the effigy.</li>
            <li>A short cutscene will start where your character will attach themselves to the effigy and be sucked down into "Hell". After the cutscene, you will be returned to the map as a "ghost", as indicated by the blue effect on the screen.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>If you get too far from a gem while it is following you, it will stop following you and wait there until you return to it.</li>
                <li>Tip: When bringing the gems from the 'Cemetery' or 'Gardens,' bring them to the 'Main Hall' then sprint away from them leaving them in the 'Main Hall,' so you don't have to slowly walk from one side of the map to the other.</li>

            <li>Once all the gems are in place, they will turn into ghost versions of the suits of armour. Kill zombies near the suits to make them move toward the Pack-a-Punch. Each suit will need to be moved twice.</li>
            <li>After each suit has been moved to the Pack-a-Punch, they will create an electric triangle. Kill a Werewolf inside the triangle to make a <a href="pictures/main_ee/knight/stone.webp">Stone appear on the floor</a>.</li>

            <p class="warning">Warning: Point of No Return. Once the Door is opened, the Boss Fight will start.</p>
            <li>A large glowing green square will appear on the ground. Rotate the statues around the edge of the arena so that the beams of light they cast are pointed at this green glowing square. The white beams will turn green if they're aligned correctly. Bait the werewolf into this green square by standing in it, at which point he will become trapped and vulnerable. Shoot the Werewolf in the glowing part of the chest. After dealing enough damage (this may take multiple traps), another Max Ammo and Carpenter will spawn.</li>
            <li>Survive against Zombies, Vampires, Werewolves, and Crimson Nosferatu until the boss werewolf jumps back into the arena. When the Werewolf returns, another Max Ammo and Carpenter will spawn.</li>
            <li>This phase is similar to phase one, except the glowing green square is invisible until found by a statue. Rotate the statues around the edge of the arena until the white beams turn green. Once all three are oriented correctly, the trap is set, and you can lure the boss into the green square to damage him. Repeat enough times and the boss will die.</li>

            <li>You must play the record at the gramophones from step 2 in the <strong>reverse order</strong> of how you looked at them.</li>
             <ul>
                 <li>When placed, the record will play part of the map's secret song <a href="#song_ee">Mystery</a>.</li>
                 <li><strong>If you play the record at the gramophones in the wrong order, you have to start a new game to retry.</strong></li>

            <li>Once all the gramophones have been played, look at <a href="pictures/infinite_ammo/">this window</a> in the 'North Atrium' to spawn an invisible ghost which can't be seen but can be heard.</li>
            <li>The ghost needs to be escorted around the map, the player has to listen for the sounds the ghost makes to know where it is.</li>
            <li>Eventually, you will make your way to the 'Wine Cellar' (make sure to hold out the weapon you'd like infinite ammo for). Once you reach the bottom of the stairs, you must go prone and crawl over to <a href="pictures/infinite_ammo/">this broken barrel</a> following <a href="pictures/infinite_ammo/">this path</a>.</li>
            <li>If everything is done correctly, you will be given your rewards. (Was it worth it?)</li>
