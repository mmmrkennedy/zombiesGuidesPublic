        <li>Melee the <a href="pictures/pap/">floor panel in the 'Server Room'</a> in the Janus Towers Plaza area and pick up <a href="pictures/pap/">TEDD's head</a>.</li>
        <li>Interact with the <a href="pictures/pap/">pickup truck (called Ol' Tessie)</a> outside the Server Room to install TEDD's head.</li>
        <li>Drive Ol' Tessie to either Blackwater Lake (left out of spawn from Ol' Tessie) or Vandorn Farm (Right out of spawn).</li>
        <li>At either of these locations, you'll find a <a href="pictures/pap/">Power Pump covered in growths</a>. You need to destroy all the growths in under CHANGE ME seconds.
            <ul>
                <li> Purple eyed Zombies will start spawning as soon as you damage the first growth. They don't give a lot of points so they aren't worth killing.</li>
                <li>If you don't destroy the growths in time, they'll respawn, and you need to wait till the next round to try again.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Once you've destroyed the last growth, interact with the power switch nearby (<a href="pictures/pap/">Blackwater Lake location</a> or <a href="pictures/pap/">Vandorn Farm location</a>).</li>
        <li>Once the power is on, a gate on the road will open, and you'll be able to drive Ol' Tessie to Ashwood.</li>
        <li>Once in Ashwood, ascend either rope (<a href="pictures/pap/">left of the Garage</a> or <a href="pictures/pap/">across from the garage</a>). Make your way to the <a href="pictures/pap/">Power Pump on the bridge</a> and clear its growths. The power switch is <a href="pictures/pap/">up the stairs from the pump</a> on the Double Tap side.</li>
        <li>Once the power is on, the Garage doors will open. Drive Ol' Tessie inside and interact with the <a href="pictures/pap/">workbench</a> to install the Pack-a-Punch on the back of Ol' Tessie. Also, Ol' Tessie will gain a boost ability when you're driving; this boost can "shake off" any Ravagers on the truck.</li>

    <h2 class="section-title">Necrofluid Gauntlet</h2>
    <p class="weapon-desc">The Necrofluid Gauntlet is a Wonder Weapon that shoots spikes that stick to enemies and the environment. On reload, these spikes will be recalled to the gauntlet, restoring the players ammo and Zombies and other enemies in their way. When upgraded, the spikes can be detonated, dealing area-of-effect damage. Ammo is still returned when using this explosion ability.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Turn on the power in Ashwood, Blackwater Lake, and Vandorn Farm.
            <ul>
                <li>This is not required until later, but since you need to wait for round 8, you might as well do it now.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            On Round 8, go up to <a href="pictures/necrofluid_gauntlet/wreckage.webp">this wreckage</a>, right of the door to 'Blackwater Lake,' in the 'Janus Towers Plaza' area to spawn an Uber Klaus. Kill both phases of the Uber Klaus, and it will drop the <a href="pictures/necrofluid_gauntlet/stabilizer_chip.webp">Stabilizer Chip</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            In Ashwood, interact with the
            <a href="pictures/necrofluid_gauntlet/klaus_panel.webp">panel</a>
            on the cell in the 'Sheriff's Office' (located to the left of the Vulture Aid perk machine) to install the chip.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the panel says, "Update requires restart", rapidly throw two stun grenades at Klaus in the cell. If done correctly, a spinning-star stun effect will appear over Klaus' head.
            <ul>
                <li>A stun grenade will always spawn in the <a href="pictures/necrofluid_gauntlet/stun_grenade_server_room.webp">'Server Room'</a> in the spawn area (the room where you get TEDD's head). You'll still need to find/buy the second stun.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Klaus will break free from the chair and start following you around as a "Protector Robot" (he'll kill zombies and revive players).
            <ul>
                <li>While Klaus is active, your tactical grenade will be replaced with the "Klaus Remote Control," which enables you to direct Klaus to a specific location.</li>
                <li>After a while, Klaus will stop following you and go on cooldown. Once the cooldown is over, you can summon Klaus again for 2000 points from any of the radios around the map.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            While Klaus is active, drive Ol' Tessie (don't jump pad, you'll need the car) to the Zarya Cosmodrome.
            Command Klaus to stand in front of <a href="pictures/necrofluid_gauntlet/canister_panel.webp">this panel</a> in the 'Support Systems' area. He should stomp, and the panel will light up.
        </li>
        <li>
            Interact with the panel to activate the <a href="pictures/necrofluid_gauntlet/scanner.webp">scanner</a>.
            You'll need to stand in the red circle on the ground until the bar on the left side of your screen fills up.
            If a zombie enters the circle, progress will pause.
            <ul>
                <li>If you fail to "defend" the scanner, you can retry at the start of the next round.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            If the scan was successful, you can pick up the <a href="pictures/necrofluid_gauntlet/canister.webp">canister</a>, left of the panel.
            <ul>
                <li>While holding the canister, you can't sprint, and using a jump pad will make you drop the canister.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            With the canister, drive to Ashwood and interact with the
            <a href="pictures/necrofluid_gauntlet/power_pump_ashwood.webp">power pump</a>.
            The canister will fill with "energy."
            Once it's done, pick it up and go to Blackwater Lake, and do the same with that
            <a href="pictures/necrofluid_gauntlet/power_pump_lake.webp">power pump</a>.
            <ul>
                <li>Once the canister has "energy" inside, you have a time limit to get to the next pump.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Once you collect the energy from Blackwater Lake, drive to Vandorn Farm and get the energy from the <a href="pictures/necrofluid_gauntlet/power_pump_vandorn.webp">pump</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once you've got the energy from each pump, bring the canister to the <a href="pictures/necrofluid_gauntlet/cube.webp">Cube</a> in the 'Cellar.'
            Once you get close enough, the cube will take the energy, and the canister will disappear.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take the Jump Pad between Vandorn Farm and Janus Tower Plaza.
            While in the air, you'll see three <a href="pictures/necrofluid_gauntlet/symbols.webp">symbols</a> on the roofs of the buildings in Vandorn Farm.
            One on the Barn, one on the House, and one on the Grain Silo; note down the symbols.
            <ul>
                <li>Saving and quitting will change the symbols.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Once you have your symbols, interact with each side of the Cube in the Cellar until the three sides are showing your symbols, then interact with the
            <a href="pictures/necrofluid_gauntlet/eye.webp">Eye on the Cube</a>.
            If done correctly, the eye will disappear, and you can pick up the
            <a href="pictures/necrofluid_gauntlet/gauntlet_pick_up.webp">Necrofluid Gauntlet</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once you pick it up, you'll be locked in a circle around the Cube.
            <a href="pictures/necrofluid_gauntlet/green_orb.webp">Green orbs</a>
            will spawn around the room. Shoot an orb with the Gauntlet, then recall the spike (with the reload button) to collect it; multiple orbs can be shot and collected at once.
            Once you collect six orbs, the lockdown will end.

            You must complete four challenges, three (Vandorn Farm, Zarya Cosmodrome, Exit 115) can be done in any order, but Blackwater Lake should be done last. To start each, you need a "purple shot" for the Necrofluid Gauntlet. To obtain a purple shot:

                <li>Shoot any of the <a href="pictures/main_ee/">clock faces</a> of the broken clock tower in Ashwood with the DG-2 Turret to stop it.</li>

                <li>Ramming a "mouth" on the boss 1-2 times will break it, revealing a <a href="pictures/main_ee/">red glowing "crit" spot</a>. Try to ram/shoot this to deal more damage.</li>
                <li>Eventually, Veytharion will enter an immunity state and start spinning.</li>
