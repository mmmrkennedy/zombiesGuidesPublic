    <h2 class="section-title">DRI-11 Beamsmasher</h2>
    <p class="weapon-desc">The DRI-11 Beamsmasher can be Pack-a-Punched and doesn’t require an Easter Egg to do so. The DRI-11 Beamsmasher is available from the mystery box and via the following quest:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Obtain a weapon with the Dead Wire ammo mod. Activate the Pack-a-Punch elevator and ride it either up or down; while riding, look across from the Pack-a-Punch to see a
            <a href="pictures/beamsmasher/window.webp">window</a>
            with a
            <a href="pictures/beamsmasher/fuse_1.webp">fuse box</a>
            inside. Shoot the fuse box with Dead Wire to electrify it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once shot, the fuse box and wire connected to it should electrify. Follow the wire to the next
            <a href="pictures/beamsmasher/fuse_2.webp">fuse box</a>
            (below the elevator door, on the left side of the Pack-a-Punch machine) and shoot it with Dead Wire.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are three more fuse boxes that need to be shot in the following order:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="pictures/beamsmasher/fuse_3.webp">Inclined Lift - Behind the Pack-a-Punch machine when the elevator is at the top</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="pictures/beamsmasher/fuse_4.webp">Living Quarters - Above the AMP generator used to turn on power/Pack-a-Punch</a>
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Once all fuse boxes have been shot, the
            <a href="pictures/beamsmasher/open_doors.webp">door beside the last fuse box</a>
            will open to the 'Research Office.' Kill the
            <a href="pictures/beamsmasher/anya.webp">zombie trapped under the fallen debris</a>
            in the room. It will drop the EMF Fob for you to pick up.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the 'Sea Tower,' you'll find a
            <a href="pictures/beamsmasher/briefcase.webp">briefcase with a zombie hand</a>
            on the table right of the Elemental Pop perk machine. Interact with the briefcase to open it. Collect the
            <a href="pictures/beamsmasher/multiphasic_resonator.webp">Multiphasic Resonator</a>
            inside (this will spawn about 10 Vermin enemies).
        </li>
        <li>
            Return to 'Research Office' and interact with the
            <a href="pictures/beamsmasher/computer.webp">computer</a>, right of the crushed zombie, to place the Multiphasic Resonator.
        </li>
        <li>
            You'll now need to get a code. You can either pay Peck 5000 points in the 'Guard Station' for the code (interact with the computer first), or you can find the code yourself (recommended). To find the code, you'll need to find three computers. Each computer will display a symbol when activated, and have a corresponding letter (X, Y, or Z) on the
            <a href="pictures/beamsmasher/symbol_and_letter.webp">table beside it</a>
            (you don't have to remember the symbols or letters). Computer locations:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="pictures/beamsmasher/laptop_docks.webp">Docks - At the top of the stairs down to the docks, under the Sea Tower</a>

                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            Once all three computers are activated, return to the 'Research Office,' and interact with the computer you placed the Multiphasic Resonator on. You should see
            <a href="pictures/beamsmasher/code_input.webp">three sticky notes on the computer</a>, as well as the option to input three numbers.
        </li>
        <li>Use these symbols to determine the values for numbers 1-3. There are two ways to solve this:</li>

        <li>
            After entering the correct code, wait 1-2 rounds for the computer to finish processing. A voice line about "Coordinates" will play, notifying you it's ready. Pick up the Multiphasic Resonator and go to Castle Rock Island (
            <a href="pictures/beamsmasher/orb_1_tac_map.webp">map location</a>
            ).
        </li>
        <li>
            On 'Castle Rock Island,' you'll find a
            <a href="pictures/beamsmasher/blue_orb.webp">blue orb</a>. Interact with it to place the Multiphasic Resonator below it. The orb will randomly electrify Zombies; killing an electric zombie will drop a small energy orb. Pick up the small orb and carry it into the main large orb.
            <ul>
                <li>You can kill the Zombie while it's standing inside the large orb to avoid having to pick up the small orb.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            After bringing two small orbs to the large orb, it will fly away, and you'll be able to pick the Multiphasic Resonator back up. Follow the orb as it travels to 'Crab Island' (
            <a href="pictures/beamsmasher/orb_2_tac_map.webp">map location</a>
            ). The orb will have turned

        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat the same process on 'Crab Island' (place Multiphasic Resonator, fill large orb with two small orbs, pick up Multiphasic Resonator).
            The orb will then fly to 'Temple Island' (
            <a href="pictures/beamsmasher/orb_3_tac_map.webp">map location</a>
            ) where it is now
            <a href="pictures/beamsmasher/purple_orb.webp">purple</a>, and you'll need to repeat the process.
        </li>
        <li>
            After filling the purple orb, the Multiphasic Resonator will disappear, and the
            <a href="pictures/beamsmasher/amp_munition.webp">AMP Munition canister</a>
            will spawn below the orb for you to pick up.

            One of the Tentacle traps around the map (Spawn, Bio Lab x2, Living Quarters) will have a <a href="pictures/main_ee/broke_grate.webp">broke grate</a>, and be dripping blood.
            <ul>
                <li>All other traps will spawn with normal, unbroken grates, but after the first activation the grate will break. This makes it impossible to know which trap spawned broken, so make sure you don't use any traps up until this point unless you know which one you need.</li>

        </li>
        <li>
            Activate the trap with the broken grate, and shoot the creature that emerges with the DRI-11 Beamsmasher's beam attack (primary fire). If done correctly, it'll drop the <a href="pictures/main_ee/hard_drive.webp">Hard Drive</a> for you to pick up.

        <li>
            You'll need to find a three numbers around the map. Once you find the code, enter it into the keypad under the window on Nathan's chamber. These numbers change every new game. Number locations:

        <li>
            Once you input the code, all players need to interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/release_valve.webp">valves on the chamber</a> (there are four around the chamber) at roughly the same time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Nathan will spawn as an Amalgam, and you'll be locked in the Bio Lab. Kill him to start a cutscene (it can be skipped).

        </li>
        <li>
            Go to the Shipwreck out in the sea. Under the Shipwreck, there's a <a href="pictures/main_ee/ladder.webp">ladder</a> you can climb. If you have the Keycard, the door at the top of the ladder will open, revealing a small room with two <a href="pictures/main_ee/node_connectors.webp">Node Connectors on a workbench</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once you pick up a Node Connector, you won't be able to sprint, the room will lock down, and you'll have to survive until the door opens again. Once the lockdown is over, a Max Ammo will spawn.
        </li>
        <li>
            Around the map, two of three cables will have a missing connector. While holding a connector, interact with one of these locations to install the connector. The location that already has a connector is random each game. Cable locations:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/cable_crab_island.webp">Crab Island - On the side with the workbench, closest to the shipwreck</a></li>

        <li>Once both connectors are installed, go back to the Guard Station and grab the <a href="pictures/main_ee/hacking_device.webp">hacking device from the slot below the window</a>. You'll need to wait for the dialogue to finish, so it may take a minute to spawn.</li>

        <li>
            There are three <a href="pictures/main_ee/buoy_example.webp">buoys</a> in the Sea you'll need to hack. To hack a Buoy, hold interact while close (basically touching) to the buoy either in the water or on a boat. If you're close enough, you'll pull out the Hacking Device. Once you hack the first Buoy, a timer will start; you must hack all the Buoys under this time limit. <a href="pictures/main_ee/buoys_tac_map.webp">Locations on the map</a>.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you take too long to hack all the Buoys, you can retry immediately, but you'll need to hack every Buoy again.

        <li>
            After you hack the Buoys, quickly head to the Bio Lab and wait for the dialogue to finish.
            Three <a href="pictures/main_ee/bomb_example.webp">bombs</a> will have been armed around the Bio Lab.
            You must defuse all three bombs, by holding interact on them, before the five-minute timer ends.
            You <strong>can</strong> leave the bombs mid-defuse to defend yourself, and not lose any progress.

        </li>
        <li>
            After the cutscene, Patient 13 will spawn in the water in front of you. Patient 13 will have <a href="pictures/main_ee/red_weakpoint.webp">red glowing weak spots</a> on either shoulder. You can shoot Patient 13 anywhere, but you'll be more damage shooting the weak spots. Once you do enough damage to a weak spot, the weak spot will move to another location or disappear for a few seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once you do enough damage, Patient 13 will leave the area for a short while. You must survive until Patient 13 returns. While you're waiting, zombies will spawn infinitely, and tentacles out in the water will shoot projectiles at you. You can shoot the glowing part of these tentacles to destroy them, though there is little point to doing this as they respawn frequently. Some of the projectiles leave behind an acidic puddle on the ground, which will damage you if you stand in it.
        </li>
        <li>
            After surviving long enough, Patient 13 will return to the arena and a Max Ammo power-up will spawn.

            When Patient 13 comes back, it can be in one of two states.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In the first state, its tentacles will glow yellow, and it'll be immune everywhere else. Patient 13 will occasionally slam these tentacles onto the arena, so make sure to stay near the boxes in either corner.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the other state, Patient 13 will gain armour (looks like fiery rock) which you'll do heavily reduced damage to. Its mouth will glow which is its weak point.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Once damaged enough, Patient 13 will leave again, and you have to survive until it returns. This time is the same as the last, except Amalgams will spawn. Another Max Ammo will spawn when Patient 13 returns.
        </li>
        <li class="dummy-li">
            <p class="boss-fight-phases">Phase 3</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            When Patient 13 returns, it'll have new attacks:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Patient 13 will start glowing with electricity, and it'll form an electric ball above its head (the edges of your screen will glow blue). You can either choose to hide or stun Patient 13. You can stun it by doing enough damage to the glowing "eyes" on its head. You can also hide behind crates in the corners of the arena to avoid being instantly put into Last Stand.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Patient 13 will extend its tongue onto the arena. Any player hit by the tongue will begin to be slowly dragged into the boss's mouth. If you're grabbed, shoot the weak points on the boss' shoulder to be broken free. If dragged into the mouth, you will be spit out in Last Stand.
