            Three valves need to be activated in and around the 'Village Square.' The Valves need to be interacted with till the dial lights up green and reaches 60. Releasing interact before a valve is finished will cause it to quickly drop back down to 0. The locations can be easily found by following the
            <a href="pictures/power/valve_generator.webp">tubes coming from the "generator"</a>
            left of the Armour station in the 'Village Square.' This will also indicate which valves have been activated. Valve locations:

            until it stops.

        <li>Once you've gotten enough kills, the Geistkraft device will rise into a hole in the ceiling.</li>
        <li>
            Return to the 'Command Room' and interact with the
            <a href="pictures/tesla_gun/tesla_button.webp">button on the upper platform</a>. The Geistkraft device will begin to move into the 'Laboratory.'

        <li>
            Once the device reaches the
            <a href="pictures/tesla_gun/tesla_lab_generator.webp">electrical generator</a>
            near the Schnellblitz (Speed Cola) machine, it will enter the generator. After about 15-20 seconds, the generator will eject a

            for you to pick up.
        </li>
        <li>
            The device will now move into the 'Morgue.' Follow it, and continue killing zombies inside the red circle on the ground to charge it. Once it reaches the Morgue generator, wait about 30 seconds, and a
            <a href="pictures/tesla_gun/tesla_part_morgue.webp">piece of the Tesla Gun</a>
            will appear inside the generator for you to pick up.

        <li>When you return to the Command Room, a Brenner Zombie will spawn on the upper platform where you first activated the Geistkraft device.</li>
        <li>
            After defeating the Brenner, go back to the upper platform. In the center of that area, you'll be able to
            <a href="pictures/tesla_gun/tesla_build_loc.webp">place the Tesla Gun parts</a>. Once both parts are placed, wait for the machine to finish assembling the weapon. When it's done, you can pick up the Tesla Gun.

        <li>You will need to shoot a generator down from the Zeppelin (same way as during the Main Quest), and charge it.</li>
        <li>Once you have a charged battery, lure the Panzermörder near it. Shoot the Panzermörder to stun it. While stunned, it will drop to one knee, and you can attach the battery to it.</li>

        </li>
        <li>You will need to get 25-30 kills using the Red Talon Sword in one play through of the song, so wait till you hear the song restart (indicated by the record static) then start to get your kills. The record head will accurately indicate how far into the song you are, with it starting on the edge and moving in.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If you don't get enough kills by the time the song is over, your kills will reset, and you will have to try again.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            If you get enough kills, the record player will stop accepting Zombie energy, the

            will start flashing green and red, and the player will make a clicking sound.
        </li>
        <li>You must watch the light on the player, and count the number of green flashes. There will be four sets of green flashes followed by a red flash to indicate the sequence will repeat. There will be a dead space between green flashes that indicated that the set of green is over.</li>
        <li>
            Once you have the set of numbers from the Record, go the "Emperor's Chamber" and input the numbers into the middle machine (the Voice of God) in

        <li>All players will be teleported to a slightly modified version of the Village, with the Panzermörder slowly chasing you around, and the Zeppelin flying overhead. The Panzermörder can occasionally charge at you, swinging its arms, dealing massive damage.</li>
        <li>You will need to shoot a generator down from the Zeppelin. However, there will only be one of the four lights lit on the Zeppelin. Once the generator falls, find it and charge it.</li>
        <li>Once you have a charged battery, lure the Panzermörder near it. Shoot the Panzermörder to stun it. While stunned, it will drop to one knee, and you can attach the battery to it. In the Hardcore boss fight, it will not be stunned for as long as in the casual version.</li>
        <li>After you attach a battery, the Panzermörder will leave the arena, and Zombies will start spawning. You don't need to kill the Zombies, just wait for the Panzermörder to return after a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Repeat until three batteries are attached. This will end the Boss Fight.</li>
