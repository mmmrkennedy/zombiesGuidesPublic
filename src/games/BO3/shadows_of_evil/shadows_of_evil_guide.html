    <h2 class="section-title">Beast Mode</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Beast Mode is a special timed mode you can enter (similar to Afterlife in BO2's Mob of the Dead) that allows you to do actions (open doors, power perks, etc.) that you can't do otherwise.</li>
        <li>
            You can enter Beast Mode by interacting with any
            <a href="pictures/beast_mode/beast_mode_chalice.webp">flaming chalice around the map</a>. Once a chalice is used (by any player), it will remain inactive for the remainder of the round, indicated by a <a href="pictures/beast_mode/red_chalice.webp">dull, red glow</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can enter Beast Mode once per round (or three per round on Solo). If the Beast icon, on the bottom-left of the HUD, is lit up
            <a href="pictures/beast_mode/beast_mode_icon_blue.webp">blue</a>, then you can enter Beast Mode. The icon will be
            <a href="pictures/beast_mode/red_beast_icon.webp">red</a>
            if you have no Beast Mode "charges" left. You will get a Beast Mode charge back at the start of each round (only one per round on solo also).
        </li>
        <li>Beast Mode lasts 25 seconds, but meleeing (whether you hit something or not) will drain 3% of you Beast "time." Once it's over, you'll be brought back to the Chalice you entered. Unlike Afterlife, letting the timer run out will not down you in, but just return you to normal.</li>
        <li>While in Beast Mode, enemies will ignore you, and you run a lot faster. You can power fuse boxes with the shock attack, destroy special doors and crates by meleeing them, grapple up to otherwise inaccessible places, shock and melee Zombies, and revive teammates. Reviving a teammate in Beast Mode will instantly return you to normal.</li>

            that will give you a variety of loot items (like guns, power-ups, etc.) when opened. Every couple of rounds (if not opened), the Pods will grow larger and change colour, from
            <a href="pictures/fumigator_pods/green_pod.webp">Green</a>

            <a href="pictures/fumigator_pods/red_pod.webp">Red</a>, then to <a href="pictures/fumigator_pods/purple_pod.webp">Purple</a>. The colour indicates the quality of the reward you can get. Pods will regrow to Green a couple of rounds after being opened.

            To open a Pod, you'll need to find a Fumigator. Each player will need their own Fumigator to open pods. Once you have a Fumigator, interact with a Pod to open it. Only one Fumigator will spawn per district. Fumigator locations:

With each failure to capture the Shadowman, 2 seconds will be added to the time you have to get him to the Ritual Table.
            <ul>
                <li>Once the Shadowman's shield is broken, a Max Ammo power-up will spawn beside one of the Keepers/Gateworms near the Shadowman.</li>
                <li>The Shadowman has an attack that can deactivate all currently activated Keepers, making you have to activate them again. He will hold the Summoning Key above his head, and it will start to glow purple. Once the attack is started, you have about 8-10 seconds to cancel it. This attack can only be cancelled by activating all four Keepers before he attacks.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Once you've captured the Shadowman in the Summoning Key, the boss fight will end. If you don't have four players in the game, the Main Quest will end here, and you can continue your game as normal. There's no reward.</li>

        <li class="dummy-li">
            <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step4">Destroy the Giant Gateworm (4-Player Only)</p>
        </li>
        <li>If you do have four players, a giant Gateworm will appear on top of the ritual table, where you captured the Shadowman. After a couple of seconds, the giant Gateworm will disappear and all players will become "corrupted" (indicated by the red mist on screen).</li>
        <li>
            You must find a
            <a href="pictures/main_ee/white_orb.webp">white orb</a>
            and walk into it to temporarily clean the corruption (a white orb will always spawn on the ritual table). Once you see the corruption on screen, you'll have 15 seconds to cleanse it, or you'll be downed. If you're in Beast Mode when you get corrupted, and you fail to cleanse, you will lose 40% of your Beast Mode "health." This corruption will return every 30-45 seconds. This corruption will linger until you complete this section of the Main Quest.
        </li>
        <li>
            Zombies will no longer spawn, instead
            <a href="pictures/main_ee/purple_margwa.webp">purple-mouth Margwas</a>
            will spawn. Killing one of these Margwas will activate a couple of Beast Mode chalices around the map.
        </li>
        <li>During this part of the Main Quest, your Beast Mode will have an infinite duration, but Margwas can still see and attack you. Taking damage in Beast Mode will take chunks off your Beast Mode meter; if it hits zero, you'll be removed from Beast Mode.</li>
        <li>
            In the middle of the Junction, the
            <a href="pictures/main_ee/keepers_and_big_gateworm.webp">giant Gateworm and three Keepers</a>
            will spawn where the train tracks from each district meet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your overall goal is to destroy the giant creature in the sky. To do this, you'll need to destroy the giant Gateworm in the middle of the Junction by hitting it with the train, then shock the three Keepers in the Junction while the train tracks are electrified. If the tracks and Keepers are electrifed while the giant Gateworm is gone, the Keepers will fire a beam at the creature, ending the Main Quest.
            <ul>
                <li>If you fail to fire the beam, the giant Gateworm will respawn, and you can retry as soon as you're ready.</li>
                <li>Since rounds no longer progress, any players that bleed-out will be respawned immediately when the train is called to a station.</li>
                <li>
                    To explain this easier, I will divide this part into what each player needs to do:

                            Player 1 - Shock the Rails:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Enter Beast Mode and wait inside any of the train stations. Player 1 (or Player 2) should have the train in their station.</li>
                                <li>
                                    Once the train is in motion (described later), you need to shock the
                                    <a href="pictures/main_ee/train_fuse_example.webp">power box in the train station</a>
                                    to electrify the rails. The rails will glow
                                    <a href="pictures/main_ee/electric_rails.webp">blue</a>
                                    when electrified. The rails only stay electrified for 30 seconds, so it's recommended to just spam shock the box until you win, or fail and need to reset.

                                <li>Make sure to either leave Beast Mode and kill any nearby Margwas, or kite them away from the station, so they don't bother you when your shocking the rails.</li>
