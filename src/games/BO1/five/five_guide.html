<div class="content-container" data-section-ind="Map Progression" id="power">
    <h2 class="section-title">Power</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Power Switch can be found <a href="pictures/power/power_switch.webp">in the Labs</a> (the bottom level). The switch in the second room on the left, in the <a href="pictures/power/power_room_outside.webp">room with the large "3" on the wall</a>, when coming from the elevator</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="content-container" id="teleporters">
    <h2 class="section-title">Teleporters</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Once you turn on the power, <a href="pictures/teleporters/teleporter.webp">teleporters</a> around the map will become active.</li>
        <li>Running into one will teleport you somewhere random around the map. There's no way to control where you're sent.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="content-container" id="pap">
    <h2 class="section-title">Pack-a-Punch</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Turn on <a href="#power">Power</a>.</li>
        <li>Around the War Room (second level), there are five <a href="pictures/pap/defcon_lower_elevator.webp">Defcon switches</a> on the walls around the room. Defcon starts at 1, and interacting with a switch will increase the Defcon by 1. Interact with all four switches. Switch locations:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="pictures/pap/defcon_lower_elevator.webp">Left of the Elevator down to the lower level</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures/pap/defcon_jug.webp">Between the Juggernog and Mule Kick machine</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures/pap/defcon_catwalk_close.webp">On the left when coming out of the first Elevator</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures/pap/defcon_catwalk_far.webp">On the far side of the catwalk from the first Elevator</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Once you interact with all four switches, Defcon will be 5, and all Teleporters will take you to the "Panic Room." Inside is the <a href="pictures/pap/pap_machine.webp">Pack-a-Punch machine</a>. The doors to the room will stay closed, and no zombies will spawn inside for about 30 seconds, giving you time to Pack-a-Punch.</li>
        <li>Once the doors open, the Pack-a-Punch will become unusable. Once the last player leaves the room, the doors will close, and you'll have to activate the switches to re-enter.</li>
    </ul>
</div>


<div class="content-container" id="thief_round">
    <h2 class="section-title">Pentagon Thief Special Round / Bonfire Sale Powerup</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Instead of the standard Hellhound Max Ammo rounds, the <a href="pictures/thief_round/pentagon_thief.webp">Pentagon Thief</a> will spawn from one of the teleporters.</li>
        <li>He'll only be visible to the player he's targeting, or one he's already targeted. Other players can see a subtle red cloud indicating his location.</li>
        <li>He'll chase you (he is faster than you) and steal your currently held weapon once he gets to you. You'll both be teleported somewhere, and he'll either chase another player or run between teleporters.</li>
        <li>After teleporting enough times, he won't reappear, and you'll permanently lose your guns. A Max Ammo powerup will spawn at the last teleporter he entered.</li>
        <li>If you manage to kill him before he teleports the last time, you'll get your guns back, and Max Ammo and Fire Sale drops will spawn.</li>
        <li>If you manage to kill him <strong>before</strong> he takes anyone's weapons, he'll drop a <a href="pictures/thief_round/bonfire_sale_powerup.webp">Bonfire Sale powerup</a>. This powerup will immediately make all teleporters take you to Pack-a-Punch, and its cost will be reduced to 1000 points.</li>
    </ul>
