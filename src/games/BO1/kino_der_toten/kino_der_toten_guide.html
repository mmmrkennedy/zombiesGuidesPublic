        <li>You have 30 seconds to Pack-a-Punch before you're forcefully teleported back. Any weapon in the machine when you teleport will be permanently lost.

        <li>The teleporter will go on cooldown for 1 minute. You'll need to link the pad and the mainframe every time you want to teleport.</li>
