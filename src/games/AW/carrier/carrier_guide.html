        <li>Obtain the Teleport Grenades and navigate to the Cargo Deck. You now need to activate Chompy. A small room behind the wall can be seen as the wall opens to either let Chompy in or out. You need to shoot a Teleport Grenade inside the room before the door closes. Once teleported inside, activate the power generator in there which will power-up the Grenade Disposal Machine and the Weapon Disposal Machine. You will now be teleported outside the room.</li>
